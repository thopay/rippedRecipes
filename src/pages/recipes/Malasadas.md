ingredients: ["2 1/4 cups (12 1/3 ounces), bread flour","1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces), sugar, plus 1 cup for coating","2 1/4 teaspoons, instant or rapid-rise yeast","1/2 teaspoon, salt","3/4 cup, whole milk","2 , large eggs","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted and cooled","1 tablespoon plus 2 quarts, vegetable oil"]
serves: 
time: "1¼ hours, plus 2 to 2¾ hours rising"
instructions: ["Whisk flour, ¼ cup sugar, yeast, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk milk, eggs, and melted butter in separate bowl until combined. Add milk mixture to flour mixture. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is uniform, shiny, and sticky, about 8 minutes (dough will not clear bottom or sides of bowl).","Using greased rubber spatula, transfer dough to greased large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1½ to 2 hours.","Brush rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil. Turn out dough onto sheet and gently press down to deflate. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces and evenly space pieces on sheet. Using your greased hands, pat each piece of dough into 3½-inch disk (about ⅜ inch thick). Cover sheet with plastic and let dough rise at room temperature until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.","Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet. Add remaining 2 quarts oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 1½ inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Gently drop 4 dough disks into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes, flipping disks halfway through frying. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 325 and 350 degrees.","Using slotted spoon or spider skimmer, transfer malasadas to prepared wire rack. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining dough disks in 2 batches. Place remaining 1 cup sugar in large bowl. Lightly toss malasadas, one at a time, in sugar to coat. Transfer to platter. Serve immediately."]
