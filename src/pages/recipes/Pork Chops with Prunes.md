Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chops and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side (chops will still be raw). Transfer chops to plate; set aside.","Add butter to fat left in skillet and melt over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Off heat, stir in brandy and thyme sprigs. Return skillet to heat and cook until brandy is almost evaporated, about 3 minutes.","Stir in cream, broth, lemon zest, remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper and bring to simmer. Nestle chops into sauce and add any accumulated juices. Cover and cook until pork registers 140 degrees, about 4 minutes. Transfer chops to carving board and let rest while finishing sauce.","Add prunes to sauce. Bring to boil over medium-high heat and cook, uncovered, until prunes have softened and sauce has thickened slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs. Slice chops, transfer to platter, and top with sauce and prunes. Sprinkle with chives and serve."]
