ingredients: ["8 ounces, ground pork","6 , scallions, white and green parts separated and sliced thin","3 , garlic cloves, minced","2 teaspoons, grated fresh ginger","3 cups (7 ounces), coleslaw mix","4 ounces, shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and chopped","3 tablespoons, soy sauce","1 tablespoon, sugar","1 tablespoon, distilled white vinegar","2 teaspoons, toasted sesame oil","8 , egg roll wrappers","2 cups, vegetable oil"]
serves: 
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Cook pork in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink, about 5 minutes, breaking up meat with spoon. Add scallion whites, garlic, and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coleslaw mix, mushrooms, soy sauce, sugar, and vinegar and cook until cabbage is just softened, about 3 minutes.","Off heat, stir in sesame oil and scallion greens. Transfer pork mixture to large plate, spread into even layer, and refrigerate until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.","Fill small bowl with water. Working with 1 egg roll wrapper at a time, orient wrappers on counter so 1 corner points toward edge of counter. Place lightly packed ⅓ cup filling on lower half of wrapper and mold it with your fingers into neat cylindrical shape. Using your fingertips, moisten entire border of wrapper with thin film of water.","Fold bottom corner of wrapper up and over filling and press it down on other side of filling. Fold both side corners of wrapper in over filling and press gently to seal. Roll filling up over itself until wrapper is fully sealed. Leave egg roll seam side down on counter and cover with damp paper towel while shaping remaining egg rolls.","Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels. Heat vegetable oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat to 325 degrees. Using tongs, place all egg rolls in skillet, seam side down, and cook until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared plate and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Serve. TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 4, transfer egg rolls to parchment paper–lined plate, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Alternatively, freeze egg rolls on plate, then transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Do not thaw before cooking; increase cooking time by about 1 minute per side."]

notes: "This recipe can easily be doubled: Extend the cooking time of the pork mixture to about 5 minutes in step 1 and fry the egg rolls in two batches. We like to serve the egg rolls with duck sauce, Chinese hot mustard, and Soy-Vinegar Dipping Sauce."
