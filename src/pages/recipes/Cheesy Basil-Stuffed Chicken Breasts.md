notes: "Avoid thin chicken breasts for this recipe—they are difficult to stuff without tearing. Whole-milk block mozzarella will provide the creamiest filling; preshredded or part-skim mozzarella will also work, but the filling will be grainy. To make fresh bread crumbs, process 2 slices of hearty white sandwich bread in the food processor."
