serves: 2
time: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["Bring 1½ quarts water to boil in large saucepan. Add pasta and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until al dente. Reserve ½ cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot.","Add 1 cup Pecorino, butter, and reserved cooking water to pasta. Set pot over low heat and, using tongs, toss and stir vigorously to thoroughly combine, about 1 minute. Remove pot from heat, cover, and let pasta sit for 1 minute.","Add pepper and toss pasta vigorously once more so sauce thoroughly coats pasta and any cheese clumps are emulsified into sauce, about 30 seconds. (Mixture may look wet at this point, but pasta will absorb excess moisture as it cools slightly.)","Transfer pasta to individual bowls. Sprinkle with remaining ¼ cup Pecorino and drizzle with oil. Serve immediately, passing extra pepper separately."]

notes: "High-quality ingredients are essential in this dish; most important, use imported Pecorino Romano—not the bland domestic cheese labeled “Romano.” For the best results, grate the cheese on a rasp-style grater. Do not adjust the amount of water for cooking the pasta; the starchy cooking water is essential for the sauce."
