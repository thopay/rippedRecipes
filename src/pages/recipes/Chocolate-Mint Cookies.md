ingredients: ["12 tablespoons, unsalted butter, softened","1 1/2 cups packed (10 1/2 ounces), brown sugar","2 tablespoons, water","2 cups (12 ounces), semisweet chocolate chips","2 1/2 cups (12 1/2 ounces), all-purpose flour","1 1/4 teaspoons, baking soda","1/2 teaspoon, salt","2 large, eggs","45 , Creme de Menthe Andes Mints, foil wrappers removed"]
serves: 45
time: "1¼ hours, plus 1 hour chilling, and 30 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Combine butter, sugar, and water in medium saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted, about 3 minutes. Add chocolate chips and stir constantly until chips are melted. Transfer mixture to bowl of stand mixer and let cool for 10 minutes. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in separate bowl.","Fit mixer with paddle, add eggs to bowl with chocolate mixture, and beat on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture in 3 additions, and mix until just ­combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with half of dough, roll heaping tablespoons of dough into balls and place 2 inches apart on prepared sheets. Bake until just set, 7 to 9 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking.","After removing cookies from oven, immediately place 1 Andes Mint in center of each cookie. Let stand until chocolate is softened, about 5 minutes, then spread chocolate over tops of cookies. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 30 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough and Andes Mints. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]

notes: "You’ll need two packages of Andes Mints for this recipe. This dough needs to chill for at least 1 hour before baking. A small, offset spatula makes it easy to spread the softened chocolate over the cookies."
