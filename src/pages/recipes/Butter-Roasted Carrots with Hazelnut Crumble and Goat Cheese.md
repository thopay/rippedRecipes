Pour 4 tablespoons melted butter onto rimmed baking sheet; tilt and swirl sheet until surface is evenly coated with butter.","Cut carrots in half crosswise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise. Toss carrots, salt, pepper, and remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter together in large bowl, then arrange carrots in even layer on prepared sheet. Roast carrots on lowest rack until well browned on bottoms and paring knife inserted into thickest carrots meets with little resistance, 40 to 50 minutes.","Using spatula, transfer carrots to serving platter.

notes: "Look for carrots that are 1 to 1½ inches in diameter at the larger end; larger or smaller carrots may need to be cooked for a slightly longer or slightly shorter time, respectively. The carrots may appear crowded on the baking sheet in step 4; this is OK."
