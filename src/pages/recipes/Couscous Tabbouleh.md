notes: "For the best results, be sure to use a high-quality olive oil. Freshly squeezed lemon juice and a ripe, seasonal tomato are also essential here. Make sure to truly mince the shallot and garlic, since big pieces of either will be too pungent. Look for bright green herbs with firm, healthy leaves. Its OK to use the tender, thin stems at the base of the parsley leaves."
