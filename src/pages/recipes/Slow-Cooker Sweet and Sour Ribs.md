description: "The best sweet and sour ribs brown in the oven while their sauce reduces to a potent, sticky glaze. We wanted to make this dish in a slow cooker, where browning and evaporation are minimal."

serves: 6
time: "4 to 5 hours on low"
instructions: ["Pulse onion and pepper in food processor until finely chopped; transfer to bowl. Add ginger, garlic, and tomato paste to empty processor and pulse until coarsely ground. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook onion mixture until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in pineapple juice concentrate, jelly, sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup vinegar, and pepper flakes and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. (Sauce can be refrigerated in airtight container for 2 days.)","Pat ribs dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Following photos, arrange ribs with wide ends pointing down and meaty side against interior wall of slow cooker; pour sauce over ribs. Cover and cook on low until ribs are tender, 4 to 5 hours (or cook on high 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours). Transfer ribs to cutting board and tent with foil.","Strain and defat cooking liquid, discard solids, and pour liquid into large skillet. Simmer over medium heat until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Whisk cornstarch and remaining soy sauce in small bowl, then stir into skillet. Cook until sauce is glossy and thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in remaining vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Transfer sauce to large bowl. Slice ribs between bones, add to bowl with sauce, and toss until well coated. Serve."]

notes: "Racks of ribs larger than 2 pounds will not properly fit in most slow cookers; ribs larger than 11/2 pounds may require an extra 30 to 60 minutes of cooking time."
