With mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons sugar and whip until just stiff and glossy, about 1 minute; set aside.","FINISH BATTER Combine flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl. Whisk water, oil, egg yolks, and almond extract in medium bowl until smooth. Whisk wet mixture into flour mixture until smooth. Whisk one-third whipped egg whites into batter, then gently fold in remaining whites, 1 scoop at a time, until well combined. Scrape mixture into 16-cup ungreased tube pan.","BAKE CAKE Bake until tooth- pick inserted into center comes out clean and cracks in cake appear dry, 55 to 65 minutes.

notes: "Separate the eggs when they’re cold; it’s easier. You will need a tube pan with a removable bottom for this recipe. Our favorite, the Chicago Metallic Professional Nonstick Angel Food Cake Pan, has both a removable bottom and “feet” to support the pan while the cake cools. If your pan is footless, invert the cake onto the neck of a wine bottle to cool."
