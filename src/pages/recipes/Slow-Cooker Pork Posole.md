notes: "Do not rinse the hominy after draining it; its starchiness gives the soup extra body. We like to serve this posole with a variety of toppings, such as diced avocado, thinly sliced radishes, chopped fresh cilantro, and lime wedges. Morton &amp; Bassett Chili Powder is our taste test favorite."
