ingredients: ["1 pound, boneless beef short ribs, trimmed and cut into ½-inch cubes","1/2 teaspoon, table salt","1/2 teaspoon, pepper","1 teaspoon, vegetable oil","2 , hamburger buns, toasted and buttered","1/4 cup, mayonnaise","1 , scallion, minced","1 tablespoon, white miso","1 teaspoon, rice vinegar","1/4 teaspoon, pepper"]
serves: 2
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["For the burger: Distribute beef in even layer on large plate. Freeze until very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, 25 to 35 minutes.","For the sauce: Whisk all ingredients together in bowl.","Pulse half of beef in food processor until ground into ⅙-inch pieces, about 20 pulses. Return ground beef to plate. Repeat with remaining beef. Pick through ground beef and discard any long strands of gristle or large chunks of fat (for short ribs, typically about 4 ounces).","Divide beef in half and gently form into 2 patties, ¾ inch thick and about 4 inches in diameter. Patties should weigh roughly 6 ounces each. Sprinkle patties on both sides with salt and pepper, using spatula to flip patties.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Using spatula, transfer patties to skillet and cook, without moving them, for 3 minutes. Gently flip patties and continue to cook until well browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Off heat, cover and let sit until meat registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), about 2 minutes. (For medium, let sit for 3 minutes to reach 130 to 135 degrees; for medium-well, let sit for 4 minutes to reach 140 to 145 degrees.) Transfer burgers to plate, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.","Transfer burgers to bun bottoms, add sauce, and cap with bun tops. Serve."]

notes: "Bone-in English-style beef short ribs can be used if boneless are unavailable. You will need to purchase 1½ pounds; be sure to remove all silverskin and excess fat next to the bone. While we prefer short ribs, 12 ounces of sirloin steak tips or chuck-eye roast can be substituted. (We use less of those cuts to start because there is less fat and gristle to discard.) If youd like to top your burgers with cheese, do so right before covering the skillet in step 5."
