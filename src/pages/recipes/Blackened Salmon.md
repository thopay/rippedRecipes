notes: "For the best results, use salmon fillets of the same size and thickness; to ensure uniform pieces of fish, you can purchase a whole center-cut salmon fillet and cut it into four equal pieces yourself. Use a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet to prevent the fish from sticking and to ensure that the blackening seasoning adheres. This cooking technique will create a good amount of smoke, so be sure to turn on your exhaust fan or crack open a window prior to cooking."
