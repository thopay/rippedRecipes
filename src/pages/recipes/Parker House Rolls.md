ingredients: ["1 1/4 cups (10 ounces), whole milk, room temperature","2 tablespoons, sugar","2 1/4 teaspoons, instant or rapid-rise yeast","1 , large egg, room temperature","4 cups (20 ounces), all-purpose flour","1 1/2 teaspoons, salt","14 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted, divided"]
serves: 24
time: "4 to 5 hours, plus 15 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk milk, 8 tablespoons melted butter, egg, and sugar in 4-cup liquid measuring cup until sugar has dissolved.","Fit mixer with dough hook. Slowly add milk mixture to flour mixture on low speed and mix until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl but sticks to bottom, about 8 minutes.","Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to form smooth, round ball, about 30 seconds. Place dough seam side down in lightly greased large bowl or container; cover tightly with plastic wrap; and let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1½ hours.","Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Press down on dough to deflate. Transfer dough to clean counter and use bench scraper to divide in half. Stretch each half into even 12-inch log, cut each log into 12 equal pieces (about 1½ ounces each), and cover loosely with greased plastic. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time (keep remaining pieces covered), form into rough ball by stretching dough with your thumbs and pinching edges together on bottom so top is smooth. Place ball seam side down on clean counter and, using your cupped hand, drag in small circles until dough feels taut and round. Cover dough balls loosely with greased plastic and let rest for 15 minutes.","Working with few dough balls at a time, press balls into ¼-inch-thick rounds. Using thin handle of wooden spoon or dowel, firmly press down across width of rounds to create crease in center.","Brush tops of rounds with 3 tablespoons melted butter. Fold in half along crease and gently press edges to seal.","Arrange rolls on prepared sheets, spaced about 2 inches apart. Cover loosely with greased plastic and let rise until nearly doubled in size and dough springs back minimally when poked gently with your knuckle, 1 to 1½ hours. (Unrisen rolls can be refrigerated for at least 8 hours or up to 16 hours; let rolls sit at room temperature for 1 hour before baking.)","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Gently brush rolls with remaining 3 tablespoons melted butter, then mist with water. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer rolls to wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."]

notes: "With their unique folds, buttery gloss, and tender crumb, Parker House rolls are classic American dinner rolls at their very best. When rounding the dough and shaping the rolls, it is important to keep the remaining dough covered, otherwise it will quickly dry out and develop a skin. Rolling the dough into symmetrical rounds takes a little practice, but you will quickly get the hang of it. A dry, unfloured work surface helps because the dough will stick a little. Although we like using a French-style rolling pin for flattening the rolls, a more traditional option is a thin dowel or the handle of a wooden spoon. Whatever your choice, lightly flour it or the dough will stick to it."
