notes: "Its best to serve this cake the same day you make it; the crunchy crumb topping will soften if covered or stored for more than a day. Low-fat cakes are prone to toughness, especially if overmixed. Once the ingredients just come together, stop mixing. Low-fat cakes are also prone to dryness, especially if overbaked--even slightly. Pull the cake out of the oven just before you think its done. Residual heat from the pan will finish the baking."
