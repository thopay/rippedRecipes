Whisk 1 tablespoon oil, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in bowl; set dressing aside.","Cut tenderloin crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Stand pieces cut side up on cutting board, cover with plastic wrap, and pound with meat pounder to even 1/4-inch thickness. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and season with pepper.","Place flour in shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in second shallow dish. Combine panko, grated Parmesan, parsley, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in third shallow dish.","Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess; dip in eggs, allowing excess to drip off; and coat with panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer to large plate.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels. Heat remaining 1 cup oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place 2 cutlets in skillet and cook until deep golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side, gently pressing on cutlets with spatula to ensure even browning.","Transfer cutlets to prepared plate and let drain on each side for 15 seconds, then transfer to prepared rack and place rack in oven to keep cutlets warm. Repeat with remaining 2 cutlets.","Just before serving, gently toss arugula with shaved Parmesan and dressing. Serve pork with salad, passing lemon wedges separately. TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 4, cutlets can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 hours before frying."]
