instructions: ["For the stuffing: Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Cook onion until golden, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds; transfer to large bowl and let cool. Add ground pork, bread crumbs, parsley, fennel seeds, pepper flakes, salt, and egg to bowl with onion mixture and knead with hands until well combined.","For the pork: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine sugar, salt, and pepper in small bowl. Butterfly pork and pound to ¾-inch thickness; you should have rectangle measuring about 15 by 8 inches. With long side facing you, cut pounded pork in half crosswise. Spread stuffing in even layer over each half of pork, leaving a 1-inch border around edges. Roll and tie each half securely with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Rub roasts evenly with sugar mixture and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Cover baking sheet tightly with foil and roast until meat registers 170 degrees, about 2 hours.","Remove foil and increase oven temperature to 400 degrees. Cook until roasts are well browned and meat registers 190 degrees, about 30 minutes. Transfer roasts to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 20 minutes. Remove kitchen twine. Slice and serve."]

notes: "Boneless pork shoulder, often labeled Boston butt, is usually wrapped in netting. If all you can find is a bone-in roast, have the butcher remove the bone. To make the bread crumbs, pulse 1 or 2 pieces of hearty white sandwich bread in a food processor until coarsely ground."
