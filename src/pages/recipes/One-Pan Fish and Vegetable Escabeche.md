instructions: ["Sprinkle cod with ¾ teaspoon salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper. Place flour in shallow dish. Dredge cod lightly in flour and shake off excess. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of cod and cook until lightly browned and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer cod to 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining cod and nestle it snugly into dish.","Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic to oil remaining in skillet and cook until just softened, about 1 minute. Add onion, bell pepper, zucchini, carrot, capers, thyme, oregano, bay leaves, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, tossing occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 3 to 5 minutes.","Stir in vinegar, hot sauce, remaining ¾ teaspoon salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon pepper and bring to simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste (mixture should be a little salty). Off heat, stir in cilantro and scallions. Pour hot vegetable mixture over cod and let sit for 30 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Serve at room temperature or chilled. (Cod and vegetables in sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)"]
