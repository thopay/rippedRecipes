Place pork in bowl and microwave until heated through, 2 to 5 minutes. Using two forks, pull into shreds. Let cool slightly, then stir in scallions, olives, cheese, cilantro, and chipotle.","Assembe turnovers: Cut each dough round in half. Arrange one-quarter of filling on one side of each half, leaving Â½-inch border around edges. Brush edges of dough with water, fold over filling, and crimp edges to seal. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Using fork, dock dough at 2-inch intervals so steam can escape. Bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Serve."]
