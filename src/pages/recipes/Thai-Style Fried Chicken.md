instructions: ["Combine 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 6 garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons white pepper, and 1 teaspoon pepper flakes in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Add chicken to marinade, seal bag, and turn to distribute marinade. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.","Meanwhile, combine chili sauce, vinegar, remaining 1½ tablespoons fish sauce, remaining 1 teaspoon soy sauce, remaining 1 garlic clove, remaining ½ teaspoon white pepper, and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper flakes in large bowl. Set aside.","Whisk flour, cornstarch, water, and baking powder in second large bowl until smooth. Add chicken and marinade to batter and stir to coat.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.","Working with one-third of chicken, 1 piece at a time, remove from batter, allowing excess to drip back into bowl, and add to hot oil. Cook until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes, stirring gently as needed to prevent pieces from sticking together. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 350 and 375 degrees. Transfer chicken to prepared rack. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining chicken in 2 batches.","Add fried chicken, cilantro, and basil to bowl with reserved chili sauce mixture and toss to combine. Transfer chicken to serving platter. Serve with extra chili sauce."]

notes: "Boneless chicken breasts can be substituted for the chicken thighs; halve the breasts horizontally before slicing them crosswise into 1-inch-thick strips. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more for this recipe. We developed this recipe using Bobs Red Mill Stone Ground White Rice Flour."
