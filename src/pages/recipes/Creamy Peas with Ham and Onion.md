description: "Most cooks boil peas until tender in salted water. But this method doesnt add much flavor to the peas. We wanted to cook and flavor the peas at the same time."

notes: "Because the cream is reduced to the proper consistency before the peas are added to the pan, the peas should be cooked with the cover on. The ham and onion add plenty of sweetness, so this recipe doesnâ€™t require any sugar."
