notes: "Youll need about three medium onions for this recipe. Try to find skirt steaks with an even thickness throughout to allow for more even cooking. It is difficult to take an accurate temperature on skirt steaks because they are so thin; if you have trouble getting a reading, rely on the times in the recipe. Depending on the length of your whole skirt steaks, you will get anywhere from five to eight portions once the steaks are cut into 3-inch sections. Fresh lime juice is essential here. Youll need a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a lid for this recipe."
