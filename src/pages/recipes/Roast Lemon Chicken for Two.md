instructions: ["Combine 1 teaspoon parsley, lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl. Using your fingers, gently loosen skin from breast along rib side, taking care to not remove it completely. Divide zest mixture evenly beneath skin of each breast. Season breasts all over with salt and pepper. Transfer to plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Heat oil in 10-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chicken, skin side down, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes.","Flip chicken skin side up and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until chicken registers 160 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest while preparing sauce.","Whisk cornstarch into broth. Add broth mixture to now-empty skillet and bring to boil over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits. (Skillet handle will be hot.) Cook until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1/3 cup, about 6 minutes. Pour any accumulated juices from plate into sauce. Off heat, whisk in butter, thyme, lemon juice, and remaining 1 teaspoon parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Carve chicken from bone and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
