serves: 6
time: ""
instructions: ["Whisk vinegar, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 6 tablespoons oil in large bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup dressing and set aside for finishing salad.","Slice potatoes into 3/4-inch planks, unpeeled onion into 1/2-inch rounds, and bell pepper according to photos. Bring potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, and enough water to cover potatoes by 1 inch to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until edges of potatoes begin to soften but centers are still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes thoroughly in colander, transfer to medium bowl, and toss with 2 more tablespoons oil. Toss onion and pepper with remaining tablespoon oil in separate bowl. Season vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.","Grill vegetables, uncovered, over moderate fire until well charred on both sides, 5 to 10 minutes per side (onions and peppers will take less time than potatoes). Remove vegetables from grill. Using tongs, remove skin from onions. Cut onions and peppers into 3/4-inch pieces and potatoes into quarters.","Toss grilled vegetables with dressing (not 1/4 cup reserved dressing). Toss in capers and cool salad to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Just before serving, toss with remaining 1/4 cup dressing and parsley. Adjust seasonings and serve."]

notes: "This salad is best served at room temperature; this gives the potatoes time to soak up the flavors of the dressing. If you choose to serve it warm, let the salad rest for 15 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld. Look for potatoes that are 3 to 4 inches around; you will need about six for this recipe."
