serves: 12
time: "1½ hours, plus 3 hours setting and 1 hour chilling"
instructions: ["For the pastry cream: Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar, and cornstarch in medium bowl until mixture is pale yellow and thick, about 1 minute; set aside. Combine milk, salt, and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar.","Gradually whisk half of milk mixture into yolk mixture to temper. Return milk-yolk mixture to saucepan. Return to simmer over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thickened and 3 or 4 bubbles burst on surface, about 3 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla. Transfer mixture to clean bowl, press parchment paper directly onto surface, and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.","For the biscuits: Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt together in large bowl. Stir milk, cream, and melted butter together in small bowl (butter will form clumps).","Add dairy mixture to flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until just combined. Using greased ¼-cup dry measuring cup, drop 12 scant scoops of batter 1½ inches apart on prepared sheet. Bake until biscuit tops are golden brown, about 12 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer biscuits to wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.","For the strawberries: Set aside 6 strawberries. Hull remaining strawberries and cut into ½-inch pieces. Combine cut strawberries, sugar, Grand Marnier, and salt in large bowl. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.","For the whipped cream: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.","Drain strawberries in colander set in bowl, reserving all juice. Whisk chilled pastry cream to recombine. Break 4 biscuits into 1-inch pieces and arrange on bottom of 3½-quart trifle dish. Pour one-third of reserved strawberry juice over biscuits. Top with one-third of strawberries, followed by one-third of pastry cream. Spread 1 cup whipped cream evenly over pastry cream. Repeat layers twice. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. Hull reserved strawberries and slice thin, then shingle in center of trifle. Serve."]

notes: "We call for a 3½-quart trifle dish for this recipe; however, a 4-quart bowl can be used in its place. Individual trifles can also be made in twelve 1-cup jars or cups."
