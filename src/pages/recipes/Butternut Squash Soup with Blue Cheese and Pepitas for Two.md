notes: "A medium shallot is a little larger than a golf ball and should yield about 3 tablespoons when it’s chopped. To make this soup vegetarian, use vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth. We prefer crumbling a block of blue cheese ourselves, but store-bought blue cheese crumbles will work fine here. If you don’t have a blender, an immersion blender will also work; just puree the soup right in the saucepan. Serve with crusty bread, if desired."
