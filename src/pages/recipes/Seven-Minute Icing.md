time: ""
instructions: ["Bring 1 inch water to simmer in medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk water, egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and salt together in medium bowl large enough to rest on sides of saucepan, but not deep enough to touch simmering water inside. Place bowl over barely simmering water, and using electric hand mixer, beat egg white mixture on medium-high speed until it forms stiff peaks, 6 to 8 minutes.","Remove bowl from saucepan, add vanilla, and continue to beat until mixture is cooled to room temperature and icing is very thick and stiff, about 8 to 10 minutes. Use immediately."]

notes: "This recipe gets its name for the seven minutes that it takes to beat it over simmering water. In step 2, you can speed up the cooling down process by transferring the hot egg white mixture to a standing mixer and beat on medium-high speed until thick and stiff, about 5 minutes."
