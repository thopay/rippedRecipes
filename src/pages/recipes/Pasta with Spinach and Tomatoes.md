time: "55 minutes"
instructions: ["Place spinach and ¼ cup water in large bowl. Cover bowl with large dinner plate and microwave until spinach is wilted and decreased in volume by half, about 5 minutes. Using potholders, remove bowl from microwave and keep covered, 1 minute. Carefully remove plate and transfer spinach to colander set in sink. Using rubber spatula, gently press spinach against colander to release excess liquid. Transfer spinach to cutting board and roughly chop, then place in clean dish towel and squeeze to remove excess water.","Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and cook until glossy green, about 2 minutes. Transfer spinach to bowl and set aside.","Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 4 tablespoons oil, remaining garlic, tomato paste, and pepper flakes to now-empty skillet and cook until fragrant and tomato paste has darkened slightly, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to strong simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato sauce has thickened slightly and few tomato chunks remain, 15 to 18 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add spinach to sauce, cover, and keep warm.","Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add fettuccine and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve ½ cup cooking water, then drain fettuccine and return it to pot. Add sauce and toss to combine. Adjust consistency with reserved cooking water as needed. Serve with Pecorino."]
