serves: 8
time: "1½ hours, plus 30 minutes macerating and 2 hours cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE PEACHES: Toss peaches, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Let sit at room temperature until peaches exude juice, about 30 minutes. Drain peaches in colander set over bowl; reserve 2 tablespoons juice.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 9-inch springform pan.","FOR THE TOPPING: Stir flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in bowl. Stir in melted butter until clumps form. Set aside.","FOR THE CAKE: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in bowl. Whisk sour cream, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, almond extract, and reserved peach juice together in large bowl. Add flour mixture to sour cream mixture and stir until just combined (batter will be quite thick). Stir preserves into batter until just combined (some chunks of preserves may be visible; this is OK).","Transfer batter to prepared pan and spread into even layer. Arrange peaches in concentric circles over batter, overlapping slightly as needed. Sprinkle topping over peaches.","Bake until topping is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out with few crumbs attached, 45 to 50 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool completely, about 2 hours. Run thin knife between cake and side of pan; remove side of pan. Cut into wedges and serve."]

notes: "You can use either light or dark brown sugar in this recipe. If you have anything less than peak-of-the-season fresh peaches, its probably best to opt for frozen peaches."
