notes: "You can substitute cherry tomatoes for the grape tomatoes, if desired. To cut the romaine lettuce hearts into ½-inch pieces, cut each heart in half lengthwise and then cut each half lengthwise into quarters. Finally, cut each quarter crosswise into ½-inch pieces. Buy whole chunks of salami and provolone here rather than deli slices."
