time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Place peppercorns in zipper-lock bag, press out air, and seal. Pound and roll peppercorns with rolling pin until coarsely cracked. Pat filets dry with paper towels and season with salt and cracked pepper. Place filets between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and roll and pound lightly with rolling pin to even 1-inch thickness.","Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place filets in skillet and cook until well browned and registering 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to plate, tent with aluminum foil, and set aside.","Reduce heat to low and melt 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty skillet. Add shallot and cook until translucent, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and add broth, 1/2 cup cognac, Worcestershire, and any accumulated meat juices from plate. Return skillet to medium-high heat and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Cook until reduced to 1/3 cup, 5 to 7 minutes.","Off heat, whisk in 1 tablespoon chives, mustard, lemon juice, remaining 4 tablespoons butter, and remaining 1 teaspoon cognac until fully incorporated. Transfer filets to platter, spoon sauce over top, and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon chives. Serve."]

notes: "Four well-trimmed (9- to 11-ounce) New York strip steaks may be substituted for the filets mignons, if desired. Cook them in two batches with an extra tablespoon of oil. Adding the cognac along with the beef broth helps reduce any potential flare-ups, but still use caution when bringing the sauce to a boil, especially if you have a gas stove."
