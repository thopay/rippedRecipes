notes: "The zucchini slices will break down as they cook and create a base for the sauce; do not be alarmed when the slices turn soft and creamy and lose their shape. The test kitchen’s favorite spaghetti is De Cecco Spaghetti No. 12. To make this recipe more plant-based, use Vegan Parmesan Substitute in place of the Pecorino Romano."
