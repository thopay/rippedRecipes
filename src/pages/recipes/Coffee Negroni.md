notes: "We like to serve these cocktails straight up (stirred with ice but served without ice); if you prefer, strain cocktails into chilled glasses half-filled with ice or with one large ice cube each. We prefer our homemade Coffee Liqueur in this recipe, but you can substitute your favorite store-bought coffee liqueur. Twist the orange peel over the cocktail just before serving to extract its flavorful oils."
