instructions: ["Adjust 1 oven rack to lower-middle position and second rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat oven to 475 degrees. Trim outer leaves of cauliflower and cut stem flush with bottom of head. Cut head into 8 equal wedges, keeping core and florets intact.","Gently toss cauliflower, shallots, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 tablespoon sage, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together on rimmed baking sheet to combine. Position vegetables cut sides down in single layer in center of sheet.","Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Leaving drumsticks and thighs attached, make 4 parallel diagonal slashes in chicken: 1 across drumsticks, 1 across leg joints, and 2 across thighs (each slash should reach bone). Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place 1 piece of chicken, skin side up, in each corner of sheet (chicken should rest directly on sheet, not on vegetables).","Whisk garlic, lemon zest, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon sage together in bowl. Brush skin side of chicken with seasoned oil mixture (use all of it). Transfer sheet to lower-middle oven rack and bake until cauliflower is browned, shallots are tender, and chicken registers at least 175 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes.","Remove sheet from oven and heat broiler. Scatter tomatoes over vegetables and place sheet on upper oven rack. Broil until chicken skin is browned and crisp and tomatoes have started to wilt, 3 to 5 minutes.","Transfer sheet to wire rack and let rest for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges."]

notes: "Note that this recipe calls for kosher salt, not table salt. Some leg quarters are sold with the backbone attached. Be sure to remove it (we like to use a heavy chef’s knife for this task) before cooking to make serving easier. If you substitute cherry tomatoes for the grape tomatoes, cut them in half before adding them to the sheet in step 5."
