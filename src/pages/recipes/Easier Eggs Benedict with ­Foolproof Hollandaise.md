Off heat, whisk in lemon juice, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and cayenne. Remove saucepan from heat (keep bowl over water bath) and season with salt to taste. Cover to keep warm.","FOR THE EGGS BENEDICT: Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Arrange English muffins split side up on baking sheet and broil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Place 1 slice bacon on each muffin half and broil until hot and beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Remove sheet from oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil.","Fill 12-inch skillet nearly to rim with water. Add vinegar and salt and bring to boil over high heat. Crack 2 eggs into each of 4 cups. Carefully and simultaneously pour eggs into skillet. Cover pan, remove from heat, and poach eggs until whites are set but yolks are still slightly runny, 4 minutes.

Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons hollandaise over each egg. Serve, passing remaining hollandaise separately."]

notes: "An instant-read thermometer is essential to this recipe. For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a full kettle of water to a boil and then measure out the desired amount. Our favorite English muffins are Bays English Muffins."
