Place squash trimmed side down on cutting board, halve squash lengthwise, scrape out seeds, and cut each half into 4 wedges.","Toss squash with oil, salt, and pepper in large bowl until evenly coated. Arrange squash cut side down in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Roast until side touching sheet is deep golden brown, about 25 minutes. Using spatula, carefully flip each wedge onto second cut side and continue to roast until well browned on second side, about 10 minutes longer.","FOR THE TOPPING: Meanwhile, combine pine nuts and oil in small saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until pine nuts are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Off heat, whisk in honey, lemon juice, and salt.","Using spatula, gently transfer squash to serving platter. Drizzle evenly with pine nut mixture and sprinkle with parsley. Serve."]
