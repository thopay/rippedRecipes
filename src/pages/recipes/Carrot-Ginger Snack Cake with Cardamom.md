Stir in flour mixture with rubber spatula until just combined.","Transfer batter to prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 33 to 38 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.

Let cake cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 3 hours.","FOR THE FROSTING: Process cream cheese, sugar, butter, vanilla, and salt in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed.","Spread frosting evenly over surface of cake, leaving ½-inch border.

notes: "Shred the carrots in a food processor fitted with the shredding disk or on the large holes of a box grater. One pound of carrots is about six medium carrots and will yield about 12 ounces of shredded carrots after peeling and trimming."
