notes: "Although stir-frying is quick, the vegetable preparation can be tedious. Thanks to the local supermarket salad bar, you can cut out most of the work. Choose vegetables from each category listed below. If you like, instead of pork you can use flank steak or boneless chicken breasts cut into thin, 2-inch-long slices."
