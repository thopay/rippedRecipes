instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees.

Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and pepper.","Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken breasts, skin side down, in skillet, and cook until well browned and most fat has rendered, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn chicken and lightly brown on second side, 2 to 3 minutes longer.","Transfer chicken to medium baking dish and set aside. Discard fat in skillet and add apricot mixture. Simmer vigorously over high heat, stirring constantly, until thick and syrupy, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour glaze over chicken and turn chicken skin side down.","Bake, turning chicken skin side up halfway through cooking, until thickest part of breast registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 12 to 16 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter and let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, transfer glaze remaining in baking dish to small bowl. Serve chicken, passing extra glaze separately."]

notes: "To make sure that the chicken cooks evenly, buy large, split chicken breasts that are similar in size--about 12 ounces apiece. Stovetops vary, so check the chicken after about 6 minutes to make sure it isnt browning too quickly."
