notes: "Burrata is cream-filled fresh mozzarella cheese. Two 4-ounce balls of burrata can be used if you cant find an 8-ounce ball. To crack the pepper, either adjust your pepper mill to the coarse-grind setting or smash a few peppercorns with a rolling pin in a zipper-lock bag. Cider vinegar can be substituted for the white wine vinegar, if desired."
