Whisk flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in bowl; set aside.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat sugar and butter on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 2 additions until well combined, scraping down bowl as needed.","Divide dough into 20 heaping tablespoons and roll into balls. On lightly floured counter, press each ball into 3-inch circle. Place 2 mini-marshmallows in center of each circle and wrap dough around mixture, pinching to seal. Roll into smooth ball and pinch to seal any cracks where marshmallows are exposed. Place in liners in muffin tin.","Bake until just set, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating muffin tin halfway through baking. Let cookies cool in muffin tin for 15 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely.","Microwave chocolate chips in bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 1 minute. Spread chocolate over cookies and let set for at least 20 minutes before serving."]
