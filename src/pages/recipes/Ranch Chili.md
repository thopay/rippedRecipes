description: "As good as this recipe could (and should) be, most recipes turn out tough, bland, dried-out pork and soggy overcooked beans. We wanted a spicy, sweet ranch-style chili, brimming with tender pork and creamy beans."

Remove bacon with slotted spoon to plate lined with paper towels; pour all but 2 teaspoons fat from pot into small bowl; set aside.","Increase heat to medium-high, add half of meat to now-empty pot and cook until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned meat to bowl. Brown remaining meat, adding another 2 teaspoons bacon fat to pot if necessary. Transfer second batch of meat to bowl.","Reduce heat to medium-low and add 3 tablespoons bacon fat to now-empty pot. Add onion, jalapenos, chili powder, cumin, and oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are beginning to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and brown sugar; cook until just fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add diced tomatoes and scrape pot bottom to loosen browned bits. Add reserved bacon, browned pork, and water; bring to simmer. Continue to cook, uncovered, at slow simmer until meat is tender and juices are dark and starting to thicken, about 2 hours.","Add beans, reduce heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

notes: "For spicier chili, boost the heat with a pinch of cayenne or a dash of hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco. This chili tastes even better when made a day in advance. If you plan to serve it the next day, dont add the beans unitl you have reheated the chili--this will keep them nice and firm. Good choices for condiments include diced fresh tomatoes, lime wedges, diced avocado, sliced scallions,  chopped red onion, chopped cilantro leaves, sour cream, and shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese."
