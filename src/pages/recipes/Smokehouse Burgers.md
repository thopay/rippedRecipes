description: "True to their name, we wanted these smokehouse burgers to be infused with real-deal smokehouse flavor. For traditional barbecue flavor, we mix barbecue sauce into the meat, cover the patties with a spice rub, and smoke the burgers over soaked hardwood chips."

serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Gently knead beef, barbecue sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in large bowl until well incorporated. Shape meat mixture into four 1-inch-thick patties. Combine onion powder, garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in small bowl; sprinkle spice mixture evenly over both sides of patties.","Seal wood chips in foil packet, cut vent holes in top, and place packet directly on primary burner. Heat all burners on high, covered, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and shut other burner(s) off. (For charcoal grill, light 100 coals; when covered with fine gray ash, spread over half of grill. Place foil packet directly on coals. Set cooking grate in place and heat, covered, with lid vent completely open, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 5 minutes.) Scrape and oil cooking grate.","Arrange burgers on hotter side of grill but not directly over foil packet. (If working on small gas grill, see related information below.) Grill burgers, covered, until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Move burgers to cooler side of grill and continue to cook, covered, to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer to plate, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "Bull’s-Eye is our preferred brand of barbecue sauce, but feel free to substitute your favorite. Making large burgers enables the meat to absorb more smoke and seasoning; these big smokehouse burgers fit better on bulkie or kaiser rolls than on standard hamburger buns. Toasting the rolls on the grill adds even more smoke flavor."
