Add chocolate and bring to simmer, whisking occasionally and scraping down sides of saucepan as necessary, over medium heat.","Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly with heatproof rubber spatula and scraping edges and bottom of saucepan until thickened and large bubbles appear at surface, 2 to 4 minutes. (Mixture will become thick and glossy.) Off heat, stir in vanilla.","Immediately pour pudding through fine-mesh strainer and into large bowl, pushing gently with spatula leaving any solids in strainer.
