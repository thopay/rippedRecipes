notes: "Note that the macaroni has not been cooked when its combined with the cheeses and cornstarch in step 1 of the recipe. For the best results, ask for a 4-ounce block of American cheese at the deli counter and shred it on the large holes of a box grater yourself. We developed this recipe using a ceramic baking dish. If you choose to use a metal baking pan, reduce the cooking time in step 2 to 25 minutes."
