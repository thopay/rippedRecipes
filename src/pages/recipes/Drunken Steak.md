description: "The idea behind this dish is to get the steaks drunk in a potent marinade of bold ingredients before grilling. While the sugar in the alcohol helps create a thick, caramelized crust on the steaks, we needed to find a happy medium with flavor."

notes: "Other thin steaks with a loose grain, such as skirt or steak tips, can be substituted for the flank steak. Avoid dark or spiced rum here—its intense flavor will overwhelm the steak. If using a gas grill, grill the steak covered for maximum heat output."
