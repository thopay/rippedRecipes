notes: "Buy plain frozen pearl onions, not those that come frozen in a sauce. Also, keep the onions frozen until youre ready to cook--the moisture they release during cooking replaces some of the water typically used for skillet steaming. Both light and dark brown sugar work in this recipe. This recipe tastes great as is, but a squeeze of lemon just before serving is a nice touch."
