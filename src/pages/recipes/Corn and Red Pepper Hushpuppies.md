instructions: ["MAKE BATTER: Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cayenne in large bowl. Whisk in buttermilk, eggs, and onion until combined. Stir in corn, bell pepper, and scallions. Mixture should be texture of muffin batter, thick enough to briefly hold a dinner spoon upright. Add extra flour if necessary to correct texture. Let batter sit at room temperature for 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.","FRY HUSHPUPPIES Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Drop half of batter into oil in heaping tablespoons and fry until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, turning hushpuppies halfway through cooking. Transfer to wire rack set over rimmed baking sheet and repeat with remaining batter. Serve. (Hushpuppies can be refrigerated in airtight container for 2 days. Reheat in 450-degree oven for about 10 minutes.)"]

notes: "Avoid coarsely ground cornmeal, which will make the hushpuppies gritty. If you dont have buttermilk, whisk 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice into 3/4 milk and let it stand for 10 minutes."
