instructions: ["FOR THE BISCUITS: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt together in large bowl. Combine ­buttermilk and melted butter in bowl and stir until butter forms clumps. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated.","Using floured fingers, break off 1-inch pieces of dough and scatter evenly on baking sheets. Bake until tops are deep golden brown, about 25 ­minutes, rotating and switching baking sheets halfway through. Let biscuits cool on baking sheets. When biscuits are cool enough to handle, crumble into ½-inch pieces into large bowl.","FOR THE DRESSING: Grease 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and celery and cook, ­covered, until softened and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in sage, thyme, pepper, and salt and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with biscuits.","Whisk broth and eggs together in bowl. Add broth mixture to biscuits and vegetables and stir gently to combine. Let sit until biscuits have softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking dish and press gently into even layer. Bake dressing on lower-middle rack until top is golden brown and crisp, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating dish halfway through baking. Let cool for 20 minutes. Serve."]
