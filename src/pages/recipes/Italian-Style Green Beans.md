notes: "The old green bean casserole has become a cliche. Thankfully, Cheryl Ewing of Ellwood City, Pa. shared with us her revamped version of this tired casserole. We love that her recipe uses common pantry items and that not one of them is cream of mushroom soup! Cheryl’s recipe was a runner-up in our holiday side dish recipe contest."
