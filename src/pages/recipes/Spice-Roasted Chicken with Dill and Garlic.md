instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine dill, salt, granulated garlic, and pepper in bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Transfer chicken, breast side down, to 12-inch ovensafe skillet and rub exposed side with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with half of spice mixture. Flip chicken breast side up and rub exposed side with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with remaining spice mixture.","Transfer skillet to oven and roast until breast registers 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs register 175 degrees, about 1 hour. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes. Reserve drippings in skillet.","While chicken rests, dissolve cornstarch in water. Carefully skim as much fat as possible from drippings and discard. Add cornstarch mixture to drippings and place over medium-high heat, whisking to scrape up any browned bits. Cook until mixture is boiling and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, whisk in lemon juice. Carve chicken and serve, passing sauce separately."]

notes: "We developed this recipe in a stainless-steel skillet, but a 12-inch cast-iron skillet will also work. If using table salt, reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon."
