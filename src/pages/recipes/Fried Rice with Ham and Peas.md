notes: "When making fried rice, cold cooked rice is essential. If you dont have 4 cups of leftover rice on hand (and leaving a fresh batch to cool for several hours isnt practical), Bens Original Ready Rice is your answer. These microwavable pouches of rice are meant to be heated for 90 seconds, but we skipped this step and simply poured the contents of the package straight into the skillet. While traditional fried rice is usually made with white rice, we preferred the nutty flavor and slightly chewy texture of brown rice."
