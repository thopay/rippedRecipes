time: "2¼ hours, plus 8 hours soaking"
instructions: ["Dissolve 1 1/2 tablespoons salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well. (Soaked beans can be stored in zipper-lock bag and frozen for up to 1 month.)","Combine 12 cups water, ham hock, beans, and 1 teaspoon salt in Dutch oven. Bring to boil over high heat.

notes: "If you can’t find a ham hock, substitute 4 ounces of salt pork, omit the salt in step 2, and season to taste once finished. Monitor the water level as the beans cook: Don’t let it fall below the level of the beans before they’re done. If it does, add more water. Good garnishes include finely chopped onion, dill pickles, jalapenos, and/or tomatoes. Use the meat from the ham hock within a few days to flavor another dish. Plan ahead: The beans need to be brined for at least 8 hours before cooking."
