instructions: ["FOR THE CHICKEN: Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place breasts on cutting board, bone side down, and cover with plastic wrap. Using meat pounder, pound thick ends of breasts to 3/4- to 1-inch thickness. Season all chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Place chicken, skin side down, in cold 12-inch nonstick skillet and sprinkle with rosemary.","Cover skillet and place over medium heat. (If using electric stove, preheat burner for 3 minutes on medium heat.) Cook chicken, without moving it, until skin is light golden brown, about 15 minutes.","Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook, covered, until skin is deep golden brown and crispy and breasts register 160 degrees and thighs/drumsticks register at least 175 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer, rotating skillet halfway through cooking. (If using drumsticks, flip them during last 5 minutes of cooking.) Transfer chicken, skin side up, to platter and tent with aluminum foil.","FOR THE HERB SAUCE: While chicken rests, pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from skillet. Add cornichons, garlic, and rosemary and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds, scraping up any browned bits. Off heat, stir in water and lemon zest and juice. Whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, until smooth and emulsified.","Stir in tarragon and any accumulated chicken juices; season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve."]

notes: "For even cooking, it’s important to buy chicken pieces within the specifications given. If you prefer all dark meat, this recipe will work with a total of eight bone-in thighs or drumsticks; if you prefer all white meat, you can use four bone-in breasts. Note that the chicken is started in a cold skillet to give the fat time to render."
