serves: 4
time: "2 hours 10 minutes"
instructions: ["FOR THE SPICE MIXTURE: Combine all ingredients in bowl and set aside.","FOR THE CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. With chicken breast side down on cutting board, use kitchen shears to cut through bones on either side of backbone; discard backbone or reserve for another use. Flip chicken and press on breastbone to flatten. Tuck wingtips underneath breast. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Cut ½-inch-deep slit into drumstick-thigh joint on each side of chicken.","Sprinkle underside of chicken with 1 tablespoon spice mixture. Flip chicken and rub skin with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle chicken skin with 5 teaspoons spice mixture.","Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and heat until just smoking. Add potatoes to skillet, cut side down. Add fennel, onion, and carrots to skillet, allowing them to come into contact with bottom of skillet as much as space permits; some vegetables will have to sit on top of potatoes. Sprinkle vegetables with remaining spice mixture.","Place chicken on top of vegetables, skin side up. Transfer skillet to oven and roast until breast registers 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs register at least 175 degrees, about 1 hour.","FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, whisk all ingredients together in bowl; set aside.","Transfer chicken to carving board. Return skillet with vegetables to oven and roast until potatoes are browned on bottom, about 15 minutes.","Carve chicken, spoon sauce over top, and serve with vegetables."]

notes: "You can make this recipe in a traditional stainless-steel or ovensafe nonstick skillet, but it will take the potatoes longer to brown in step 7. Be sure to buy potatoes measuring 1 to 2 inches in diameter. If you’re using table salt, cut the amounts in half and distribute the spice mixture accordingly. If you can’t find a 1-pound bulb of fennel, buy several smaller ones. The weight of the trimmed fennel going into the skillet should be about 8 ounces."
