time: "1 hour, plus 1 hour brining"
instructions: ["Dissolve salt in 1 1/2 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge pork in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove pork from brine, pat dry with paper towels, and cut slits about 2 inches apart through fat around each chop. Season with pepper. Mix butter, chives, mustard, and lemon zest in bowl and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. (Chive butter can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 1 day.)","For a charcoal grill: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour two-thirds evenly over grill, then pour remaining coals over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","For a gas grill: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn other burner(s) to medium-low.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Grill chops (covered if using gas) on hot part of grill until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Slide chops to cool part of grill and cook until meat registers 145 degrees, 7 to 9 minutes, flipping halfway through grilling. Transfer chops to platter and top with chilled chive butter. Tent loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve."]
