serves: 24
time: "2 hours, plus 1 hour chilling and 2½ hours cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE CRUST: Whisk milk and egg yolks together. Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 pulses. Add shortening and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 pulses. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Transfer mixture to large bowl.","Pour milk mixture over flour mixture and combine, using rubber spatula to press dough firmly until it comes together. Transfer dough to clean counter and divide into 2 equal pieces. Place each piece of dough on sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 4-inch square. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for 1 hour.","FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Microwave cherries and water in covered bowl until steaming, about 1 minute. Let sit until cherries have softened and cooled to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Combine softened cherry mixture, apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl; set aside.","Let dough soften at room temperature for 10 minutes. Roll 1 dough square between 2 large sheets of parchment paper into 19 by 14-inch rectangle. Remove top piece of parchment. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin, then unroll dough over 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Gently fit dough into sheet and up the sides and sprinkle with almond paste. Drain apple mixture thoroughly, then spread over dough-lined sheet. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed.","Roll remaining 1 dough square between 2 large sheets of parchment into 19 by 14-inch rectangle. Remove top piece of parchment. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin, then unroll it over filling. Trim and fold edges of dough together. Crimp, using fork.","Cut 1-inch slits in top crust at 2-inch intervals, then brush with egg whites. Bake bars for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake until juices are bubbling and crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let bars cool in sheet on wire rack for 30 minutes.","FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk sugar, milk, and almond extract together in bowl until smooth. Drizzle glaze over bars and let cool until filling has set, about 2 hours. Cut into squares. Serve."]
