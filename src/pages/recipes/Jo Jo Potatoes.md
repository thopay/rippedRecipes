serves: 6
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Cut each potato lengthwise into 6 wedges. Place potatoes in large bowl and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave until edges of potatoes are translucent but centers remain slightly firm, 6 to 8 minutes, shaking bowl (without removing plastic) to redistribute potatoes halfway through cooking. Carefully remove plastic and drain potatoes well. Return potatoes to bowl, add 3 tablespoons oil, and stir until potatoes are coated with starchy film, about 1 minute.","Combine panko, Parmesan, paprika, dry mustard, salt, garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne in shallow dish. Dredge one-quarter of potatoes in panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer to platter and repeat with remaining potatoes. Let sit 15 minutes.","Remove hot baking sheet from oven and brush with remaining oil. Arrange potatoes, cut side down, in single layer. Bake, flipping halfway through cooking, until crisp and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve."]
