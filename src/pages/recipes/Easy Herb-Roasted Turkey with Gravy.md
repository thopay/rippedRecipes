instructions: ["FOR THE TURKEY: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Scatter onions, carrot, and celery in bottom of large roasting pan; add broth, wine, sage leaves, rosemary sprig, and thyme sprig to pan. Set V-rack over vegetables in roasting pan.","Combine butter, garlic, lemon zest, salt, pepper, minced sage, minced rosemary, and minced thyme in bowl and mix until smooth. Pat turkey dry inside and out with paper towels. Using your fingers, gently loosen skin covering breasts and leg quarters, being careful not to tear skin. Spoon half of butter mixture under skin, directly on meat. Using your hands, rub remaining butter mixture over outside of turkey. Tuck wings behind back and tie legs together with kitchen twine.","Transfer turkey, breast side up, to V-rack. Roast until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 2½ to 3 hours. Transfer turkey to cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes.","FOR THE GRAVY: Meanwhile, carefully strain contents of pan through fine-mesh strainer into fat separator; discard solids and let liquid settle for at least 5 minutes.","Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk constantly until honey-colored, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in 4 cups defatted pan juices (if necessary, add enough water to equal 4 cups) and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Carve turkey and serve with herb gravy."]

notes: "We recommend using a self-basting turkey for this recipe These turkeys are “prebrined,” meaning that they’re injected with a salt solution that helps them stay moist."
