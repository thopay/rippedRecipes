serves: 6
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["FOR THE TOPPING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Whisk flour, panko, almonds, sugar, lemon zest, and cinnamon together in bowl. Whisk melted butter, miso, and almond extract in second bowl until miso is dissolved. Stir butter mixture into flour mixture until no dry spots of flour remain and mixture forms clumps. Refrigerate until ready to use (topping can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours).","FOR THE FILLING: Toss pears, sugar, cherries, cream, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt in large bowl until thoroughly combined. Melt butter in 10-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat. Add pear mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until pears have released enough liquid to be mostly submerged and juices have thickened and turned glossy, 6 to 8 minutes. Off heat, stir to ensure cherries are evenly distributed throughout mixture.","Squeeze topping into large clumps with your hands. Crumble topping into pea-size pieces over filling. Bake until topping is browned and filling is bubbling around sides of skillet, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 2, transfer filling to shallow 1½- to 2-quart baking dish, cover, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When ready to bake, microwave filling until heated through, about 5 minutes, stirring halfway through microwaving. Continue with step 3."]

notes: "Serve with vanilla ice cream. Be sure to use white (shiro) miso—which is relatively mellow and sweet—in this recipe. If you cant find it, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of table salt. Dried cranberries can be substituted for the cherries."
