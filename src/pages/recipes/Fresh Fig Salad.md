notes: "You can substitute prosciutto for the mortadella if you like. We prefer small figs here. If you can find only large figs, quarter them. For a nonalcoholic version, omit the port and increase the balsamic vinegar to 5 tablespoons. For the best results, we suggest buying a log of good-quality goat cheese."
