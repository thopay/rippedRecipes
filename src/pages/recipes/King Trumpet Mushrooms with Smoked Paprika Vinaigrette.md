ingredients: ["1¼ pounds king trumpet, mushrooms","1¼ teaspoons, table salt, divided","½ cup, extra-virgin olive oil","8 , garlic cloves, lightly crushed and peeled","1 sprig fresh, rosemary","¼ cup, minced fresh parsley","2 tablespoons, sherry vinegar","½ teaspoon, smoked paprika"]
serves: 4
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Trim bottom ½ inch from mushroom stems, then halve mushrooms lengthwise. Cut ¼-inch crosshatch pattern, about 1/16 inch deep, on cut sides of mushrooms. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon table salt on cut sides of mushrooms and let sit, cut sides up, for 15 minutes.","Heat oil, garlic, and rosemary in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Arrange mushroom halves, cut sides down, in even layer in pan (pan will appear crowded at first; mushrooms will shrink as they cook). Heat until bubbles begin to form around edges of mushrooms, about 2 minutes.","Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Using tongs, flip mushrooms and continue to cook, covered, until paring knife inserted into mushrooms meets little resistance, 8 to 10 minutes longer.","Flip mushrooms, cut sides down, in pan. Transfer garlic to cutting board. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, until mushrooms are golden brown on cut sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer mushrooms, cut sides up, to serving platter.","Mash garlic into paste with side of large knife. Transfer garlic to medium bowl. Carefully pour warm oil from pan into bowl with garlic paste; discard rosemary sprig. Whisk in parsley, vinegar, paprika, and remaining ¼ teaspoon table salt. Drizzle ¼ cup dressing over mushrooms. Sprinkle with flake sea salt, if desired. Serve, passing remaining dressing separately."]

notes: "Look for king trumpet mushrooms, also known as king oyster mushrooms, that are unblemished and firm and weigh about 3 ounces each. You can substitute red or white wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar. You will need a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a tight-fitting lid for this recipe."
