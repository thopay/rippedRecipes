instructions: ["FOR THE TOPPING: Using your fingers, combine granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in bowl. Cover and set aside.","FOR THE MUFFINS: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spray 12-cup muffin tin generously with vegetable oil spray. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples, brown sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Cook, stirring often, until moisture has completely evaporated and apples are well browned, about 9 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let cool for 10 minutes.","Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in large bowl. Whisk granulated sugar, eggs, oil, and remaining 4 tablespoons melted butter together in separate bowl until thick and homogeneous, about 30 seconds. Whisk cider, yogurt, and vanilla into sugar mixture until combined.","Fold sugar mixture and cooled apples into flour mixture until just combined. Using greased 1/3-cup dry measuring cup, divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups (cups will be filled to rim); sprinkle muffin tops evenly with topping.","Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few crumbs attached, 18 to 22 minutes, rotating muffin tin halfway through baking. Let muffins cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove muffins from tin to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes longer. Serve."]
