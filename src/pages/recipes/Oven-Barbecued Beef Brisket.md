instructions: ["For the brisket: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Massage dry rub into meat and poke all over with fork (see photo 1, below). Arrange half of bacon strips, overlapping slightly, crosswise on bottom of broilersafe 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Place brisket, fat side down, in bacon-lined pan and place remaining bacon strips on top, tucking ends of strips underneath brisket (see photo). Cover pan with foil and roast until fork inserted into brisket can be removed with no resistance, about 4 hours.","Remove pan from oven and carefully flip brisket fat side up. Replace foil and return brisket to oven. Turn off heat and allow brisket to rest in warm oven for 1 hour.","For the sauce: Pour accumulated juices into 1-quart measuring cup and set aside. Remove bacon from brisket, chop into small pieces, and heat in medium saucepan over medium heat until fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Off heat, add vinegar and sugar and stir to combine. Return to medium heat and reduce to syrupy consistency, about 5 minutes","Meanwhile, skim fat from reserved juices and discard fat. Add enough chicken broth to juices to make 3 cups. Add to saucepan and reduce until mixture in saucepan measures 3 cups, about 8 minutes. Off heat, stir in ketchup and chipotle. Strain through fine-mesh strainer, if desired.","Turn oven to broil. Brush brisket with 1 cup sauce and broil until top is lightly charred and fat is crisped, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to cutting board and slice across grain into 1/4-inch slices. Serve with remaining sauce.","MAKE AHEAD: Follow recipe through step one. In step 2, place the brisket fat side up on aluminum foil and wrap tightly; reserve juices in an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 3 days. When ready to proceed, remove the bacon from the brisket, rewrap the brisket in foil, and cook for 1 hour in a 350-degree oven. Proceed with the recipe from step three. In step 5, remove the foil from the brisket and proceed as directed."]
