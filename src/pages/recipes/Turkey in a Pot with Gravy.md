ingredients: ["1 (7-pound) bone-in whole, turkey breast, wings discarded, trimmed",", Salt and pepper","2 tablespoons, olive oil","1 , onion, chopped","1 , carrot, chopped","1 , celery rib, chopped","6 , garlic cloves, crushed and peeled","1 teaspoon, minced fresh thyme","1 , bay leaf","1 tablespoon, unsalted butter, melted","1/4 cup, all-purpose flour","4 cups, chicken broth"]
serves: 8
time: "3¼ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Using kitchen shears, trim any rib bones that extend beyond underside of turkey breast. (If any backbone pieces are still attached to underside of turkey, remove them.) Pat turkey dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.","Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add turkey, skin side down, and cook until well browned, 12 to 16 minutes, rolling it from side to side as needed for even browning. Transfer turkey to plate and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot. Add onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf to pot and cook until vegetables are well browned, 7 to 10 minutes.","Return turkey and accumulated juices to pot, skin side up. Off heat, place large sheet of aluminum foil over pot and press edges to seal, then cover tightly with lid. Transfer pot to oven and cook until thickest part of breast registers 155 degrees, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.","Remove pot from oven and heat broiler. Uncover pot (handles will be very hot) and brush turkey with melted butter. When broiler is heated, return pot to oven and broil until skin is golden brown, 8 to 15 minutes, rotating pot as needed for even browning. Remove pot from oven. Transfer turkey to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest while making gravy.","Place pot over medium-high heat, bring to boil, and cook until almost all liquid has evaporated, 8 to 15 minutes. Stir in flour and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook at strong simmer, stirring often, until gravy is thickened and measures about 2 cups, 15 to 18 minutes. Strain gravy through fine-mesh strainer set over medium saucepan; discard solids. Season gravy with salt and pepper to taste. Carve turkey. Rewarm gravy and serve with turkey."]

notes: "Try to purchase a turkey breast with the wings already removed so it’s sure to fit into your pot. Otherwise, remove the wings before proceeding with the recipe. A carving fork works well for turning the turkey and removing it from the pot."
