instructions: ["FOR THE RIBS: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Bring 3 cups water, espresso powder, liquid smoke, and salt to boil in small saucepan. Pour mixture into large roasting pan. Place ribs, meat side down, in liquid. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours.","FOR THE BARBECUE SAUCE: Meanwhile, heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in paprika and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth, vinegar, corn syrup, ketchup, molasses, mustard, hot sauce, and espresso powder and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced to 2 cups, 50 to 60 minutes. Stir in liquid smoke and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let cool for 20 minutes. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.)","Reserve 1/2 cup sauce for serving. Remove ribs from roasting pan and transfer, meat side up, to wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet; discard braising liquid. Brush both sides of ribs with sauce. Bake until tender and fork inserted into meat meets no resistance, about 1 1/2 hours, brushing meat side with sauce after 30 and 60 minutes of cooking. Tent ribs loosely with foil and rest for 30 minutes. Slice meat between bones and serve with reserved sauce."]
