time: "40 minutes, plus 1 hour brining"

Combine butter and 1 teaspoon spice mixture in separate bowl; set aside.","Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet.

notes: "The oven rack should be 5 inches from the broiler element. If your oven doesn’t allow this, err on the side of distance: Place the rack slightly farther from the element. For chops that are less than 1½ inches thick, decrease the cooking time."
