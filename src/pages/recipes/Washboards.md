serves: 36
time: "1¼ hour, plus 45 minutes chilling and 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in medium bowl. Whisk together egg and milk in small bowl. Place butter and brown sugar in large bowl and beat with electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg mixture and beat on medium-high, scraping down sides of bowl, until well combined, about 30 seconds. Add flour mixture and coconut, and mix on low speed until just incorporated, 15 to 30 seconds.","Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and, using floured hands, shape into 15-inch log (see photo 1, above right). Flatten top and sides of log so that it measures 1 inch high and 3 inches wide (photo 2). Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes.","Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove chilled dough from refrigerator, unwrap, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (photo 3), and arrange slices 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Dip dinner fork in flour, then make crosswise indentations in dough slices (photo 4). Bake until cookies are toasty brown, 15 to 18 minutes, rotating baking sheets halfway through baking time. Cool cookies on baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool to room temperature. Serve."]

notes: "The dough can be made ahead of time. Simply shape the dough into the rectangular log, wrap the log in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 1 month. If frozen, defrost dough on counter for 20 minutes before slicing."
