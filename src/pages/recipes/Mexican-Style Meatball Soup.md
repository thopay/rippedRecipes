instructions: ["For the meatballs: Pulse tortillas in food processor until finely chopped, with no pieces larger than ½ inch, 15 to 20 pulses. Set aside ¾ cup processed tortillas for soup. Add cilantro, egg, broth, garlic, salt, and pepper to processor with remaining tortillas and process until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.","Transfer tortilla mixture to large bowl. Add pork and mix with your hands until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into about thirty-two 1-tablespoon portions. Roll portions between your wet hands to form meatballs. Transfer to plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use. (Meatballs can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","For the soup: In clean, dry processor, process tomatoes and their juice, onion, chili powder, garlic, chipotle, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.","Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tomato mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned and starting to stick to bottom of pot, 10 to 12 minutes.","Stir in broth, zucchini, carrots, and reserved processed tortillas. Add meatballs to pot and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until meatballs are cooked through and vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with lime wedges, sprinkling individual portions with cilantro."]
