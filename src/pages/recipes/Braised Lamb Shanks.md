serves: 4
time: "4 hours 5 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Combine salt, cumin, coriander, pepper, and pepper flakes in bowl. Pat lamb shanks dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with 2 tablespoons spice mixture.","Heat 2 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add 2 lamb shanks and cook until lightly browned on both flat sides of each shank, about 2 minutes per side. (Searing here is more about toasting spices on lamb than about getting deep browning.) Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining 2 lamb shanks.","Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, onion, and garlic to now-empty pot and cook until onion just begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add broth, olives, carrots, thyme, lemon zest, soy sauce, oregano, lamb shanks, and remaining 1½ teaspoons spice mixture and bring to boil.","Cover pot, transfer to oven, and cook for 1½ hours. Remove pot from oven and flip lamb shanks. Cover pot and return to oven. Continue to cook until meat easily falls off bone when prodded with fork, about 1½ hours longer.","Transfer lamb shanks to shallow platter, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Skim fat from braising liquid with large spoon. Stir cilantro and lemon juice into braising liquid. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over lamb shanks and serve."]

notes: "Use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest from the lemon. This dish is great served over polenta, white beans, rice, or boiled potatoes—anything that will absorb the flavorful braising liquid. If you’re using table salt, cut the amount in half. If you don’t have chicken broth, you can substitute water in this recipe, but you may have to add a little more salt at the end."
