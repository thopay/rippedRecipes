Heat fat left in skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add carrots, ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining ¼ teaspoon allspice and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in couscous and cook, stirring often, until about half of grains are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in water and remaining ½ teaspoon salt and bring to boil.","Place chicken on top of couscous, skin side up.

Transfer couscous mixture to bowl with shallot mixture and toss to combine. Fold in spinach, fresh mint, half of pine nuts, and half of feta. Transfer to serving platter with chicken. Top couscous with remaining pine nuts and remaining feta. Serve."]

notes: "You will need a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a tight-fitting lid for this recipe. The skillet may appear crowded when you first add the chicken; the chicken will shrink as it cooks."
