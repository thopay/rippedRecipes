Cook, stirring constantly, until butter is nutty brown, about 5 minutes; set aside.","SIMMER POTATOES Bring potatoes to boil in large pot over high heat with 3 teaspoons salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheet. Dry potatoes with additional paper towels.","ROAST POTATOES Discard paper towels and spread potatoes in single layer. Drizzle browned butter over hot potatoes and sprinkle with remaining salt and pepper. Let sit until butter is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes, flipping once. Remove hot baking sheet from oven and brush with oil. Arrange potatoes on hot baking sheet in single layer. Bake, flipping halfway through cooking, until crisp and golden brown, about 40 minutes.
