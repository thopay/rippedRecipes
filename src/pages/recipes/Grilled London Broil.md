serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours, plus 2 hours marinating"
instructions: ["Cut ½-inch crosshatch pattern, ¼ inch deep, on both sides of steak. Place steak in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Combine soy sauce, vinegar, ketchup, sage, garlic, oil, and rosemary in blender and process until garlic and herbs are finely chopped, about 30 ­seconds. Add marinade to bag with steak, seal, and turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature for 2 hours or ­refrigerate for up to 8 hours. (If ­refrigerated, bring steak to room temperature before grilling.)","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.","Combine pepper and paprika. Remove steak from marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and season with pepper mixture.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Grill steak (over hot side of grill if using charcoal) for 1 minute. Flip and grill on second side for 1 minute. Repeat, ­flipping every minute, until steak registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, 5 to 7 minutes, or 130 degrees for medium, about 9 minutes. Transfer to carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice steak against grain. Serve."]

notes: "You can use thyme in place of the rosemary and either sweet or hot paprika. Because it’s so lean, top round, often labeled as London broil, is best served medium-rare to medium and sliced very thin (it will be tough and dry if cooked to well or beyond)."
