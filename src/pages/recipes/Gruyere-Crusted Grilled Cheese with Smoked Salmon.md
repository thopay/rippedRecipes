ingredients: ["2 teaspoons, mayonnaise","4 slices, hearty white sandwich bread","2 slices, deli American cheese (1½ ounces)","6 slices, smoked salmon (4 ounces)","1 tablespoon, fresh dill leaves","2 teaspoons, minced shallot","½ teaspoon, grated lemon zest","Pinch , pepper","4 ounces, Gruyere cheese, shredded (1 cup), divided","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter, divided"]
serves: 2
time: "35 minutes"
instructions: ["Spread mayonnaise evenly on 1 side of each slice of bread. Layer 1 slice of American cheese and 3 slices of salmon on mayonnaise side of each of 2 slices of bread. Sprinkle salmon with dill, shallot, lemon zest, and pepper. Sprinkle ¼ cup Gruyere over salmon on each sandwich, then top with remaining 2 slices of bread, mayonnaise side down.","Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place sandwiches in skillet. Cover and cook until deep golden brown on bottom, 4 to 7 minutes.","Using spatula, carefully flip sandwiches. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to center of skillet between sandwiches and tilt to distribute butter as it melts. Cover and continue to cook until second side is deep golden brown and cheese is visibly melted around edges of sandwiches, 2 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer sandwiches to wire rack.","Remove skillet from heat and wipe clean with paper towels. Sprinkle two ¼-cup portions of remaining Gruyere into rectangles just larger than slices of bread, about 6 by 4 inches, on opposite sides of now-empty skillet. Place sandwiches directly on top of Gruyere.","Return skillet to medium heat and cook until edges of Gruyere beneath sandwiches are well browned and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes. (Do not slide spatula under sandwiches before Gruyere is crisp; it will pull Gruyere and ruin crust.) When Gruyere is browned along edges, slide spatula underneath sandwiches and transfer, Gruyere crust side up, to wire rack. (For decorative purposes, you can upturn edges of Gruyere crust, if desired.)","Let sandwiches sit for 5 minutes to allow cheese to set. Transfer sandwiches to cutting board and cut diagonally. Serve."]

notes: "Its important to use a good nonstick skillet here. While crisping the cheese crust in step 5, avoid flipping the sandwiches too early. At first the cheese will be soft and melty, but it will crisp as it continues to cook. When sprinkling the cheese in the skillet for the crust, be sure to leave enough room between the portions so that the cheese doesnt run together. For the best flavor, buy the American cheese from the deli counter, not the presliced cheese that comes wrapped in cellophane."
