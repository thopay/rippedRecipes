time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Combine beef, chili powder, salt, and pepper in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until beef is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste begins to darken, about 1 minute. Add water and cook until sauce thickens and coats beef, about 4 minutes. Set aside and cover to keep warm.","Meanwhile, microwave American cheese, milk, and cherry pepper brine in bowl until cheese is fully melted, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cover to keep warm.","Split each hot dog lengthwise, stopping short of cutting completely in half, so dogs are hinged on 1 side. Grill dogs over hot fire until well browned, about 2 minutes per side. Grill buns cut side down until toasted, about 1 minute. Stir cheese sauce to recombine. Divide hot dogs, chili, and cheese sauce evenly among buns. Top with cherry peppers and onion. Serve."]
