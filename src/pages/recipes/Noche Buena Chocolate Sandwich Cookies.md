time: "1 hour, plus 40 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Process almonds in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Combine flour, cocoa, salt, and cayenne in bowl.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add melted chocolate, egg yolks, liqueur, and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture in 3 additions and mix until just combined, scraping down bowl as needed.","Working with 2 teaspoons dough at a time, roll dough into balls and place 1 inch apart on prepared sheets. Sprinkle ground almonds on top, pressing lightly to adhere. Bake until edges appear dry, 8 to 10 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes and then transfer to wire rack to cool completely, about 40 minutes.","Spread 1/2 teaspoon dulce de leche over bottom of half of cookies and then top with remaining cookies to form sandwiches. Serve. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]
