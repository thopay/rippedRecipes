Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add water, pork, and beans and bring to boil. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook until beans are just beginning to soften, about 1 hour.","FINISH BEANS: Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Bake, uncovered, until beans are completely tender and sauce is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 hours. Remove pork from pot and transfer to plate.
