description: "Picnic ham tastes like a cross between a rich pork shoulder and a salty, smoky ham. But it takes a few tricks to transform this flavorful-but-fatty cut into a tender, juicy roast."

ingredients: ["8 - 10 pound, ham (smoked picnic ham)","3 tablespoons, dry mustard","1 teaspoon, pepper","1 cup, packed dark brown sugar","1/2 cup, Dijon mustard","1/2 cup, balsamic vinegar","1/4 teaspoon, cayenne pepper","1/8 teaspoon, ground cloves","1 tablespoon, apple cider vinegar or water"]
serves: 16
time: "3 to 4 hours, plus 30 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line large roasting pan with aluminum foil. Remove skin from exterior of ham and trim fat to ¼-inch thickness. Score remaining fat at 1-inch intervals in crosshatch pattern. Combine 1 tablespoon dry mustard and pepper in small bowl. Rub ham all over with spice rub. Set ham on V-rack set inside prepared roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with foil. Bake until internal temperature registers 140 degrees, 2 to 3 hours.","Meanwhile, bring brown sugar, Dijon mustard, vinegar, remaining dry mustard, cayenne, and cloves to boil in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until reduced to 1 cup, 15 to 20 minutes. (Glaze can be refrigerated in airtight container for 3 days. Microwave glaze until bubbling around edges before using.)","Remove ham from oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees. Discard foil and brush ham evenly with ½ cup glaze. Return ham to oven and bake until dark brown and caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir cider (or water) into remaining glaze. Transfer ham to carving board, loosely tent with foil, and let rest 30 minutes. Carve (see Carving a Picnic Ham, below) and serve with cider-thinned glaze."]

notes: "We like the larger whole smoked picnic when we’re cooking for a crowd, but you can also use a shankless roast (sometimes labeled “smoked shoulder picnic” or “smoked Boston butt”). Crimp the foil tightly around the roasting pan to keep the ham moist and help the collagen render."
