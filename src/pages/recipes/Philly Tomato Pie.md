serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours, plus 3 hours rising"
instructions: ["For the dough: Spray 13 by 9-inch nonstick baking pan with vegetable oil spray. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour and yeast on medium speed until combined, about 10 seconds. With mixer running, slowly add room-temperature water and oil and mix until dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Turn off mixer, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let dough stand for 10 minutes.","Add salt to dough and knead on medium speed until dough is satiny and sticky and clears sides of bowl but still sticks to bottom, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer dough to prepared pan, cover pan tightly with plastic, and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1½ hours.","For the sauce: While dough rises, heat oil in small saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato sauce and sugar and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened and measures about 1¼ cups, about 10 minutes. Let sauce cool completely.","Using your well-oiled hands, press dough into corners of pan. (If dough resists stretching, let it rest for 10 minutes before trying to stretch again.) Cover pan tightly with plastic and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1½ hours. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.","Spread sauce evenly over dough, leaving ½- to ¼-inch border. Bake until edges are light golden brown and sauce has reduced in spots, about 20 minutes. Let tomato pie cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes. Run knife around edge of pan to loosen pie. Using spatula, slide pie onto cutting board. Cut into 8 pieces and serve."]

notes: "When kneading the dough on medium speed, the mixer may wobble and shimmy. To keep it in place, position a dish towel or shelf liner beneath the mixer and keep a close watch on it. You will need a nonstick metal baking pan for this recipe."
