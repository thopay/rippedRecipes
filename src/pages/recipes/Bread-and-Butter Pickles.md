notes: "There’s no consensus on how these sweet pickles got their name. Some claim the pickles are (like bread and butter) good enough to eat at every meal, others say it’s because they are often eaten on or with sandwiches. Another theory is that they took their name from the word smorgasbord, which translates literally as “bread and butter table.” It’s not surprising that pickles often appear as part of this Swedish buffet."
