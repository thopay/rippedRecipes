description: "Few flavors are as familiar as butterscotch. Replicating that flavor in a cookie, however, is like having a clear destination but no map."

ingredients: ["1/2 cup (3 ounces), butterscotch chips","3 tablespoons, unsalted butter, plus 9 tablespoons cut into 9 pieces, chilled","2 teaspoons, vanilla extract","3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces), dark brown sugar","1/2 teaspoon, salt","1 , large egg yolk","1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces), all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon, baking powder"]
serves: 32
time: "50 minutes, plus 2 hours chilling and 30 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Microwave butterscotch chips and 3 tablespoons butter in bowl until melted, about 1 minute, stirring halfway through. Whisk in vanilla until mixture is smooth; let cool for 10 minutes.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat remaining 9 tablespoons butter, sugar, and salt on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add cooled butterscotch mixture and beat until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl as needed. Add egg yolk and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low, add flour and baking powder, and mix until dough forms, about 1 minute.","Turn out dough onto counter and roll into 9-inch log. Wrap tightly with parchment paper and roll to form even cylinder. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. (Dough can be wrapped in aluminum foil and frozen for up to 1 month.)","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice chilled dough with sharp knife into ¼-inch-thick rounds and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets (16 cookies per sheet). Bake until edges have darkened slightly, about 15 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool for 10 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]

notes: "Use chilled butter so it won’t melt when you add the melted chips in step 2. If the chilled dough begins to split as you slice it, soften it on the counter for 10 minutes."
