serves: 10
time: "1¼ hours, plus 1¾ hours rising and 2 hour cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE DOUGH: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix all ingredients together on low speed until cohesive mass starts to form, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes.","Grease large bowl and line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead briefly to form smooth ball, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to prepared bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size and fingertip depression in dough springs back slowly, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.","Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Place dough on clean counter and divide into 8 equal pieces (about 3⅝ ounces each). Form each piece into rough ball by pinching and pulling dough edges under so that top is smooth.","Flip each ball onto smooth side and pat into 4-inch circle. Fold top edge of circle down to midline, pressing to seal. Fold bottom edge of circle up to meet first seam at midline and press to seal. Fold in half so top and bottom edges meet and pinch together to form seam. Flip dough seam side down and gently roll into 6-inch log. Arrange rolls in 2 staggered rows of 4 on prepared sheet; set aside to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.","FOR THE TOPPING: Twenty-five minutes before rolls are finished rising, whisk all ingredients together in medium bowl. Cover bowl and let topping rise until doubled in size, about 20 minutes. Stir risen topping to deflate. Spoon 2 tablespoons topping over each roll and quickly brush to evenly coat top and sides.","Transfer sheet to oven and bake until exteriors are golden brown and craggy and centers register 210 degrees, 22 to 25 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer rolls to wire rack and let cool completely before serving."]

notes: "The topping’s consistency is thick (like pancake batter); be sure to use it all. Don’t worry if the topping runs down the sides of the Dutch crunch rolls (forming a “foot” at the base of each roll) while brushing. Don’t use sweet white rice flour in this recipe."
