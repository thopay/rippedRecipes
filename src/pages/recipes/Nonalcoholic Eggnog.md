instructions: ["Whisk 3/4 cup cream, egg yolks, and sugar in medium bowl until thoroughly combined and pale yellow, about 30 seconds; set aside. Bring milk and salt to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.","When milk mixture comes to simmer, remove from heat and, whisking constantly, slowly pour into yolk mixture to temper. Return milk-yolk mixture to saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture reaches 160 degrees, 1 to 2 minutes.","Immediately pour eggnog into clean bowl. Stir in root beer and nutmeg. Fill slightly larger bowl with ice and set eggnog bowl in ice bowl. Refrigerate until eggnog registers 40 degrees, 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.","Just before serving, using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip remaining 3/4 cup cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Whisk whipped cream into chilled eggnog. Serve, garnished with extra nutmeg. (Eggnog can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)"]
