serves: 2
time: "1½ hours, plus 20 minutes standing"
instructions: ["FOR THE SAUCE: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, ¾ teaspoon salt, oregano, and pepper flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and sugar and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover with lid slightly ajar, and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes. Off heat, stir in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Cover and keep warm.","FOR THE CHICKEN AND PASTA: Remove tenderloins from breasts and reserve for another use. Pound each breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to even ½-inch thickness. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper; let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.","Bring 2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Add pasta and ½ tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve ½ cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot. Toss pasta with ¾ cup sauce. Cover and keep warm.","Meanwhile, whisk egg and flour in shallow dish until smooth. Combine Parmesan, panko, garlic powder, oregano, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in second shallow dish. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Working with 1 piece at a time, dunk chicken in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off; then dredge in panko mixture to coat both sides, pressing gently so crumbs adhere. Transfer to plate.","Adjust oven rack 4 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Heat oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully place chicken in skillet and cook until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.","Transfer chicken to rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle mozzarella evenly over top. Broil until cheese is melted and beginning to brown and chicken registers 160 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to serving plates. Top each piece with 2 tablespoons sauce and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon basil. Adjust pasta consistency with reserved cooking water as needed and serve with chicken."]

notes: "This recipe makes enough sauce to top the cutlets and up to a pound of pasta. Any extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to three days or frozen for up to a month. If the cheese browns before the chicken registers 160 degrees, cover the chicken with aluminum foil and continue to broil."
