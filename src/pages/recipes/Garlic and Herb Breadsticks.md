Using pastry brush, brush doughs with half of melted butter. Sprinkle doughs with half of thyme mixture.

notes: "If possible, buy bagged pizza dough that is still partially frozen; the yeast is more likely to be active, which will give the breadsticks a better rise during baking. Its important to let the dough come to room temperature before beginning the recipe. Do not use Pillsbury Pizza Crust here. Wait to make the thyme mixture until just before youre ready to sprinkle it; otherwise, the moisture from the fresh thyme can cause it to clump."
