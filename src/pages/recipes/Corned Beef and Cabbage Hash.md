instructions: ["Toss potatoes, beef, cabbage, onion, carrots, oil, garlic, thyme, pepper, mustard, salt, and allspice together in large bowl. Transfer mixture to 12-inch nonstick skillet and set over medium heat (skillet will be very full, but contents will cook down). Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.","Remove skillet from heat and, using potato masher, mash ingredients into coarse, cohesive mass. Spread corned beef mixture into even layer and place butter pieces along sides of skillet all around hash. Return to medium heat and cook, uncovered and undisturbed, until well browned on bottom, 5 to 7 minutes.","Flip spatula-size portions of hash and lightly repack in skillet. Cook until browned on second side, about 2 minutes. Flip again and brown bottom once more, about 2 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "Corned beef is sold both raw and fully cooked. Purchase fully cooked corned beef from the deli counter––ask the butcher to slice it ½ inch thick. You can also use cooked corned beef left over from a boiled dinner. About one-quarter of a head of green cabbage will yield 3 cups. Serve with hot sauce and a fried egg, if desired."
