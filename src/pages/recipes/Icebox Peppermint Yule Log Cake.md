With electric mixer, beat 1 1/2 cups cream, 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla, and peppermint extract in large bowl until soft peaks form. Using rubber spatula, fold crushed candy into peppermint cream.","Make cookie stacks: Spread 1 tablespoon peppermint cream on chocolate wafer. Top with another wafer and repeat 4 more times to produce stack of 6 wafers with cream in between each cookie. Make 6 stacks, each with 6 wafers. Spread 1 tablespoon peppermint cream on top of 5 stacks, leaving 1 stack plain.","Make log: Lay cookie stacks on sides and press together end to end, making one 16-inch log (plain stack without cream on top wafer should be placed at end). Wrap log in plastic and freeze until firm, at least 5 hours or up to 1 week.","Trim log: With electric mixer, beat remaining 1 1/4 cups cream, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and cocoa in large bowl until stiff peaks form. Cut thin piece diagonally from one end of frozen log and discard. Cut 2-inch piece diagonally from other end of frozen log and set aside.","Make bump: Transfer frozen cake to serving platter. Spread all but 1/2 cup cocoa cream evenly over top, sides, and ends of log. Press reserved 2-inch piece on top of log to make bump, placing it several inches from one end of log. Cover bump with remaining cocoa cream.","Decorate log: Drag tines of fork down length of log to simulate bark. Freeze until firm, at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Before serving, let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Garnish platter with candy spearmint leaves and red hot candies."]
