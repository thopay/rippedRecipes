notes: "We call for using either all white meat or all dark meat chicken in this recipe because they cook at different rates. This roughly comes out to either 4 breasts or 8 thighs, but use overall weight as your guide. If you choose to use a combination of both, you may have to remove some pieces from the oven before all the pieces are done to avoid overcooking. If you don’t feel like making your own barbecue sauce, you can substitute 1 cup of your favorite store-bought barbecue sauce in step 3. Just pour off all remaining fat from the skillet and omit the onions."
