instructions: ["FOR THE COCONUT CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil.","Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in large bowl; set aside. Whisk cream of coconut, milk, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, and coconut extract together in second large bowl. Whisk coconut mixture into flour mixture until fully combined. Gently stir in ½ cup toasted coconut until evenly distributed.","Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cake cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 1½ hours. Using foil overhang, lift coconut cake out of pan and transfer to cutting board; discard foil.","FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed.","Spread frosting evenly over surface of cake. Sprinkle frosting evenly with remaining ¼ cup toasted coconut. Serve. (Frosted cake can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "We tested this recipe using Coco Lopez brand cream of coconut, which is often found in the soda and drink-mix aisle of the grocery store. Make sure to shake or stir it well before using, because it separates as it stands. To toast the coconut, spread it on a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a 325-degree oven, stirring often, until golden brown, about 15 minutes."
