serves: 6
time: "2 hours, plus 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE DRESSING : Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl until smooth; set aside. (Dressing can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; stir to recombine and thin with water or lemon juice as needed before serving.)","FOR THE BEETS: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Toss beets with oil, garlic, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in large bowl until evenly coated. Transfer beets to 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Pour water into pan; cover tightly with aluminum foil; and roast until beets can be easily pierced with paring knife, 1 to 1¼ hours.","Remove pan from oven. Carefully remove foil, letting steam escape away from you, and return pan to oven. Roast until edges of beets are beginning to caramelize, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard garlic, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Let beets cool for 20 minutes.","Spread dressing evenly over serving platter. Arrange beets on top of dressing, then sprinkle with sesame seeds and chives. Serve warm or at room temperature."]

notes: "To ensure even cooking, we recommend using beets of similar size—roughly 2 to 3 inches in diameter. If your beets are larger, cut the wedges in half crosswise. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant (about 3 minutes); immediately remove the skillet from the heat to prevent scorching."
