notes: "One 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes will contain more than enough for this recipe. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs almost clear, about 1½ minutes, stirring the rice with your hand every so often. You can substitute brown sugar for the granulated sugar, if desired. For a spicier dish, add extra chopped cherry peppers to your hot rice."
