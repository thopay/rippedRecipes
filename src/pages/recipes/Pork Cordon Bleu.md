instructions: ["FOR THE MUSTARD SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in bowl; set aside.","FOR THE PORK: Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Place flour in shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs and mustard together in second shallow dish. Place panko in third shallow dish.","Cut tenderloin crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, arrange tenderloin pieces cut side up on cutting board. Cover with plastic wrap and pound to even ¼-inch thickness with meat pounder. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper.","Dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess; dip in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off; then coat with panko, pressing to adhere. Transfer cutlets to plate.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Place 2 cutlets in skillet and cook until golden brown on first side, about 3 minutes.","Using 2 spatulas, gently flip cutlets and continue to cook until golden brown on second side and just cooked through, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to prepared rack. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining 2 cutlets.","Spread 2 tablespoons mustard sauce over top of each cutlet, leaving ¼-inch border. Place 2 slices ham on each cutlet, folding ham as needed to keep from overhanging cutlet. Sprinkle ¼ cup Gruyere over ham on each cutlet.","Broil until Gruyere is melted and lightly browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve cutlets with remaining mustard sauce."]

notes: "For the best results, be sure to purchase a tenderloin that weighs no more than 1 pound. We like to serve these cutlets with a green salad."
