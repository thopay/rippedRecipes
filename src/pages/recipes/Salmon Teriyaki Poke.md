notes: "This recipe was inspired by the Teriyaki Salmon and Avocado in Martha Cheng’s The Poke Cookbook: The Freshest Way to Eat Fish (2017). Freshness is key when serving fish raw. The flesh of raw salmon should appear moist and shiny; feel firm to the touch (the flesh should spring right back when pressed); and smell clean, not fishy. Notify your fishmonger that you plan to serve the fish raw and inquire about its freshness. Try to have the fishmonger slice and skin a center-cut fillet of salmon to order that has little to no thin belly attached, since it can be unpleasantly chewy and fatty when eaten raw. We call for farm-raised salmon because wild-caught salmon can be prone to parasites; it must be commercially frozen to the Food and Drug Administration’s standards to be safe for raw consumption. Serve this poke as a snack or an appetizer, or make it a meal by serving it over warm rice. Furikake is a Japanese seasoning blend that comes in many styles. We recommend using a blend containing dried seaweed (nori and/or kombu), bonito flakes, and sesame seeds. Look for it at an Asian market, in the Asian section of the grocery store, or online."
