description: "Oranges dont pack the wallop of lemons-especially in baked goods. But a double hit of tangy orange glaze and a sprinkling of orange sugar provide a flavorful and attractive addition to this cake."

instructions: ["For the cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter 12-cup nonstick Bundt pan; dust pan with flour, then tap out excess. Whisk eggs, zest, juice, and vanilla in medium bowl.","With electric mixer, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt on lowest setting in large bowl. Add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat at medium-low speed until mixture is crumbly with pea-sized pieces, about 30 seconds after last tablespoon of butter is added. Add egg mixture in steady stream. Scrape down sides of bowl, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until batter is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Use rubber spatula to give batter final stir. (It's fine if batter looks slightly broken.)","Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth out surface. Bake until skewer inserted into middle of cake comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.","For the glaze and orange sugar: While cake bakes, whisk 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, juice concentrate, lemon juice, and salt in small bowl until smooth. Cool cake in pan on cooling rack for 20 minutes, then turn out onto rack placed over rimmed baking sheet. Brush still-warm cake with 1/4 cup glaze (see photo 1) and let stand until just warm, about 1 hour. Whisk remaining 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar into remaining glaze and pour evenly over top of cake (see photo 2). Using fork, mix zest and granulated sugar together in small bowl and sprinkle over glaze (see photo 3). Cool cake completely, about 2 hours. (Cake can be stored, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for up to 3 days.) Serve."]

notes: "When grating orange zest, remove just the outer orange part of the peel-the inner white part is very bitter."
