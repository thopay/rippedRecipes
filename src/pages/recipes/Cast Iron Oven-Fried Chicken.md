instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position. Place 12-inch cast-iron skillet on rack and heat oven to 450 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack with triple layer of paper towels. Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper.","Lightly beat eggs and 1 teaspoon salt together in medium bowl. Whisk flour, paprika, baking powder, granulated garlic, cayenne, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 1 tablespoon pepper together in second medium bowl. Add water to flour mixture; using your fingers, rub flour mixture and water until water is evenly incorporated and shaggy pieces of dough form.","Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, dip in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off; then dredge in flour mixture, pressing firmly to adhere. Transfer coated chicken to large plate, skin side up.","When oven temperature reaches 450 degrees, carefully remove hot skillet from oven (skillet handle will be hot). Add oil to skillet and immediately place chicken, skin side down, in skillet. Return skillet to oven and bake for 15 minutes.","Remove skillet from oven and flip chicken. Return skillet to oven and continue to bake until breasts register 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs register 175 degrees, about 15 minutes longer.","Transfer chicken, skin side up, to paper towel–lined side of prepared wire rack to blot grease from underside of chicken, then move chicken to unlined side of rack. Let chicken cool for about 10 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "To fit 3 pounds of chicken pieces, you will need a 12-inch cast-iron skillet for this recipe. Note that the cast-iron skillet should be preheated along with the oven in step 1. One 4½- to 5-pound whole chicken will yield the 3 pounds of parts called for in this recipe."
