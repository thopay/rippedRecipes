instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Combine melted butter, garlic, and thyme in small bowl. Toss fennel bulbs with 2 tablespoons butter mixture, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper in separate bowl. Spread in even layer on two-thirds of rimmed baking sheet. Toss grapes with 1 tablespoon butter mixture in now-empty bowl and spread in even layer on other third of sheet. Roast until fennel begins to soften, 12 to 14 minutes.","Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle all over with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper. Place chicken, skin side down, in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until skin is light golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.","Using spatula, push fennel and grapes to sides to clear space in center of sheet. Arrange chicken, skin side up, in clearing. Brush chicken skin with remaining 1 tablespoon butter mixture. Roast until chicken registers at least 175 degrees, about 15 minutes. Transfer fennel mixture to platter, top with chicken, and scatter with grapes. Pour accumulated juices from sheet over chicken. Sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve."]

notes: "Look for small grapes, as they release less juice when roasted. If you can find only stalkless fennel bulbs, look for those that weigh around 10 to 12 ounces each. Serve with crusty sourdough bread."
