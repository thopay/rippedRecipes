instructions: ["For the quick marinara: Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Stir in garlic, oregano, and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in wine and simmer until nearly evaporated, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and tomato sauce and cook until slightly thickened and reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in basil and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.","For the crispy chicken: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add breadcrumbs and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Let cool, then stir in Parmesan and salt; transfer to shallow dish.","Spray wire rack with cooking spray and set inside rimmed baking sheet. Spread mayonnaise over top of cutlets and transfer to crumb mixture. Arrange crumb-side up on prepared rack and spray lightly with cooking spray. Bake until crumbs are golden brown, about 8 minutes.","Top each cutlet with 1/4 cup marinara and 1 slice mozzarella. Bake until cheese has melted and chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Spoon 1/4 cup marinara evenly over plates and top with chicken. Serve, passing remaining sauce at table."]
