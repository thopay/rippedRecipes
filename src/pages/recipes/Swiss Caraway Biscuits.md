instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.","Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Stir in 3/4 cup cheese and caraway seeds. Add 1 1/4 cups cream and stir with wooden spoon until dough forms, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough from bowl to countertop, leaving dry, floury bits in bowl. In 1-tablespoon increments, add up to 1/4 cup cream to dry bits in bowl, mixing with wooden spoon after each addition, until moistened. Add moistened bits to rest of dough and knead by hand just until smooth, about 30 seconds.","Pat dough into 8-inch circle, cut into wedges, and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake until just beginning to brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven, sprinkle remaining cheese on each biscuit, and return to oven, rotating baking sheet from front to back. Bake until golden brown and cheese topping has melted, 7 to 9 minutes. Serve warm."]

notes: "Bake the biscuits immediately after cutting them. Allowing them to stand for any length of time can decrease the leavening power of the baking powder and prevent the biscuits from rising properly in the oven."
