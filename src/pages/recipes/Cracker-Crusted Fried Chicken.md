ingredients: [", Salt and pepper","2 tablespoons, Worcestershire sauce","2 tablespoons, soy sauce","2 teaspoons, cayenne pepper","2 teaspoons, granulated garlic","3 pounds, bone-in chicken pieces (split breasts cut in half crosswise, drumsticks, thighs, and/or wings), trimmed","36 square, saltines (1 sleeve)","1/2 cup, all-purpose flour","1/2 cup, cornstarch","1 teaspoon, baking powder","3 quarts, peanut or vegetable oil"]
serves: 4
time: "40 minutes, plus 1 hour brining and 30 minutes chilling"
instructions: ["Whisk 1 1/2 quarts cold water, 2 tablespoons salt, Worcestershire, soy sauce, cayenne, and granulated garlic together in large container until salt dissolves. Add chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.","Place saltines in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag, seal, and crush to medium-fine crumbs with rolling pin (you should have about 1 cup). Transfer crumbs to large bowl and whisk in flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until combined.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Set second wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack with triple layer of paper towels. Working with 1 piece at a time, remove chicken from brine and transfer to saltine mixture, pressing firmly so coating adheres to chicken. Transfer coated chicken to prepared rack (without paper towels). Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.","Add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Add half of chicken to hot oil and fry until breasts register 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs/wings register 175 degrees, 13 to 16 minutes. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 300 and 325 degrees. Transfer chicken to paper towel–lined side of second wire rack to drain on each side for 30 seconds, then move to unlined side of rack. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining chicken. Serve."]
