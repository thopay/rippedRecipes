instructions: ["Turn all burners to medium-high and heat, covered, for 15 minutes. (For charcoal grill, arrange 50 coals over bottom of grill. Light 100 coals; when covered with fine gray ash, pour evenly over cold coals. Set cooking grate in place and let heat, covered, with lid vent open completely, for 5 minutes.) Scrape and oil cooking grate. Brush onions with oil and season with pepper. Whisk beer, mustard, sugar, caraway, and 1 teaspoon pepper in 13 by 9-inch disposable aluminum pan.","Arrange disposable pan on one side of grill and grill onions on other side of grill until lightly charred, 6 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions to pan and grill sausages until browned, 6 to 10 minutes. Transfer sausages to pan, cover grill, and simmer until sausages are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove cooked sausages from pan and grill until lightly charred, about 4 minutes. Transfer sausages to platter and tent with foil.","Continue to simmer beer mixture, with grill covered, until onions are tender and sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place bratwurst in rolls and spoon on sauce and onions. Serve."]

notes: "Light-bodied lagers work best here. Depending on the size of your grill, you may need to cook the onions in 2 batches in step 2. Standard hot dog buns will be too small for the bulky brats."
