serves: 16
time: "1¼ hours, plus 1 hour cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray with vegetable oil spray.","Combine water and dates in small saucepan and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until dates are tender and liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes.","Meanwhile, pulse flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in food processor until combined, about 5 pulses. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand, about 15 pulses. Transfer to large bowl and stir in oats. Using your fingers, blend mixture until oats and flour mixture are well combined. Firmly press half of oat mixture evenly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.","Process dates in now-empty food processor until smooth, about 1 minute. Spread date puree over crust. Sprinkle remaining oat mixture over date puree, pressing lightly to adhere. Bake until top is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer pan to wire rack and let bars cool completely. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan and slide off foil onto cutting board. Cut into 16 bars."]
