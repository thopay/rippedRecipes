notes: "We prefer to use a fresh head of lettuce rather than precut bagged lettuce for this recipe. After halving and coring the head of lettuce, the half you use for the salad should weigh approximately 18 ounces and yield about 12 cups of torn pieces. Be sure to buy link pepperoni, not the presliced stuff, for the croutons."
