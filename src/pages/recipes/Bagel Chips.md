Cut any slices that barely hang together in center (from bagel's hole) in half.","Spread slices in single layer on rimmed baking sheet.

Flip slices and repeat brushing and sprinkling on second side with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and remaining ⅛ teaspoon salt.","Bake until crisp and light golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes.

notes: "Any type of savory bagel can be used in this recipe. Look for unsliced bagels, which are often available in the bakery section of the grocery store. This recipe can easily be doubled; to do so, divide the slices between two baking sheets and bake one sheet at a time."
