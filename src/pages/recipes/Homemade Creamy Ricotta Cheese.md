ingredients: ["8 cups, whole milk","3/4 teaspoon, table salt","1/4 cup, distilled white vinegar","1/4-1/2 cup, heavy cream"]
serves: 8
time: "45 minutes, plus 2 hours chilling"
instructions: ["Set large fine-mesh strainer over large bowl. Heat milk and salt in large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently with rubber spatula to prevent scorching, until milk registers 185 degrees.","Remove saucepan from heat. Add vinegar and stir until mixture curdles, about 10 seconds. Let sit, undisturbed, until mixture fully separates into curds and cloudy whey, about 5 minutes.","Using ladle, transfer curds and whey to prepared strainer. Let sit until most of whey has drained from ricotta but center is still moist, about 10 minutes.","Using rubber spatula, stir ricotta in strainer, gently scraping sides and bottom of strainer, until any excess whey has drained from ricotta, about 30 seconds (you should have at least 5½ cups whey; if not, continue stirring until you have 5½ cups whey). Discard whey. Transfer ricotta to airtight container and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.","Process ricotta and ¼ cup cream in food processor until ricotta is uniformly smooth and spreadable, about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. (Finished ricotta should have texture of buttercream frosting.) If ricotta is too stiff, add remaining cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until desired consistency is achieved. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Ricotta can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; stir to recombine before using."]

notes: "Do not use ultra-pasteurized (UHT) milk or cream in this recipe. Use a large fine-mesh strainer to drain the ricotta. If you dont have one, you can also use a colander lined with a single layer of cheesecloth, but you may need to stir longer in step 4 to drain off 5½ cups of whey. This recipe yields a creamy ricotta cheese with much smaller curds than many other homemade versions."
