description: "The French make a vinaigrette-flavored potato salad far lighter than its creamy American counterpart. Green beans and lots of herbs keep the salad bright and fresh tasting."

notes: "The key to infusing this summer-fresh salad with flavor is dressing the green beans and potatoes while they are hot. The  salad can be made up to 1 day in advance. Just bring the salad back up to room temperature and add the fresh herbs  and reserved dressing before serving. Tarragon and orange flavor this potato salad with the taste of southern France."
