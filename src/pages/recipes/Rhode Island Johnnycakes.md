description: "Golden brown and crispy outside, rich and creamy inside, these are much more than bland cornmeal pancakes. But to make them that good, we had to ignore the instructions."

ingredients: ["1 cup johnnycake meal or stone-ground, cornmeal","2 teaspoons, sugar","3/4 teaspoon, salt","2 3/4 cups, water, plus extra hot water for thinning batter","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter","2 tablespoons, vegetable oil"]
serves: 12
time: "55 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet.","Whisk johnnycake meal, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Bring water to boil in large saucepan. Slowly whisk johnnycake meal mixture into boiling water until no lumps remain; continue to cook until thickened, about 30 seconds. Off heat, whisk in butter. Pour batter into bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit until slightly firm, about 15 minutes.","Rewhisk batter until smooth. Batter should be consistency of ploppable mashed potatoes; if not, thin with 1 to 2 tablespoons extra hot water until mixture is able to drop easily from spoon.","Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering (or heat nonstick griddle to 400 degrees). Using greased 1/4-cup dry measuring cup, drop 6 evenly spaced scoops of batter into skillet, using spoon to help release batter from cup as needed. Cook johnnycakes, without moving them, until edges appear crispy and golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.","Carefully flip johnnycakes and press with spatula to flatten into 2 1/2- to 3-inch-diameter pancakes. Continue to cook until well browned on second side, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer johnnycakes to prepared wire rack and place in oven to keep warm. Whisk 2 to 4 tablespoons extra hot water into remaining batter to return to correct consistency. Repeat cooking with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and remaining batter. Serve."]

notes: "Johnnycakes are best served warm with maple butter (or maple syrup) for breakfast, or as a side dish for soups and stews. For authentic Rhode Island johnnycakes, we recommend using Kenyon’s Johnny Cake Corn Meal, made from stone-ground white flint corn and available by mail order. Do not try to turn the johnnycakes too soon or they will fall apart. If you prefer crispier johnnycakes, press the pancakes thinner in step 5."
