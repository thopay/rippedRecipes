serves: 24
time: "1 hour, plus 2 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray lightly with vegetable oil spray.","Combine cherries, 1/4 cup water, and almond extract in small bowl. Microwave, covered, until hot, about 1 minute. Let stand, covered, until cherries are soft, about 5 minutes. Microwave chocolate and butter in separate large bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 45 seconds. Whisk in oil, cocoa, and remaining 1/3 cup water. (Mixture may look curdled.)","Whisk eggs and yolks and vanilla into chocolate mixture until smooth. Whisk in sugar and salt until fully incorporated. Stir in flour until just combined. Stir in softened cherries and their liquid.","Pour batter into prepared pan, spread into corners, and smooth top with rubber spatula. Bake until slightly puffed and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few moist, fudgy crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.","Let brownies cool in pan on wire rack for 1 hour. Using foil overhang, lift brownies out of pan. Return brownies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut into squares and serve."]
