description: "Leathery, blackened beef and bland, raw vegetables are common issues with beef and vegetable kebabs. We set out to save this recipe and found that with little fuss-and minimal expense-these kebabs come off the grill nicely charred, juicy, and full of flavor."

notes: "Do not marinate the beef for more than 2 hours or it will be too salty. You will need six 12-inch metal skewers for this recipe. If you have pieces of meat smaller than 1 1/2 inches, thread two small pieces together to approximate a 1 1/2-inch cube."
