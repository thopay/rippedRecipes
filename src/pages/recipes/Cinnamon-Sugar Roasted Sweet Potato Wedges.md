notes: "We prefer to use small potatoes, about 8 ounces each, because they fit more uniformly on the baking sheet. They should be of similar size so they cook at the same rate. Be sure to scrub and dry the whole potatoes thoroughly before cutting them into wedges and tossing them with the oil and spices."
