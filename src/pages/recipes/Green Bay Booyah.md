Add beef, beef bones, and chicken and bring to boil.","Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until chicken registers 175 degrees, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to bowl. When chicken is cool enough to handle, shred into bite-size pieces, discarding bones. Cover chicken and refrigerate. Continue to simmer stew until beef is tender, about 75 minutes longer. Transfer beef to plate. When cool enough to handle, shred into bite-size pieces, discarding fat. Discard beef bones and bay leaves.

notes: "The bone side of a short rib is especially fatty and requires the most trimming. To defat the broth, lay a paper towel over its surface, quickly lift it up by a corner (the fat will adhere), and discard. Repeat with more paper towels, as needed."
