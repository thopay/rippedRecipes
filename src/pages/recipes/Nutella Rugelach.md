ingredients: ["1 1/2 cups (7½ ounces), all-purpose flour","1/4 cup (1¾ ounces), granulated sugar","1/4 teaspoon, table salt","6 ounces, cream cheese, cut into 3 pieces and chilled","10 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled","1/4 cup, sour cream","2/3 cup, Nutella, divided","1 , large egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water","1 tablespoon, demerara sugar"]
serves: 8
time: "1¾ hours, plus 1 hour 20 minutes chilling and cooling"
instructions: ["Process flour, granulated sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add cream cheese and pulse until large, irregularly sized chunks of cream cheese form with some small pieces interspersed throughout, about 5 pulses. Scatter butter over top and pulse until butter is size of large peas, 5 to 7 pulses.","Add sour cream and process until dough forms little clumps that hold together when pinched with your fingers (dough will look crumbly), about 10 seconds.","Transfer dough to clean counter and knead briefly until dough just comes together, about 3 turns. Divide dough in half (each piece should weigh about 11 ounces) and form each piece into 4-inch disk. Wrap disks individually with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll 1 dough disk into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Using offset spatula, spread ⅓ cup Nutella evenly over entire surface of circle. Using pizza wheel or sharp knife, cut through center of circle to form 16 equal wedges. Starting at wide edge of each wedge, roll dough toward point and transfer to prepared sheet, seam side down.","Wipe counter clean, dust counter with additional flour, and repeat with remaining dough disk and remaining ⅓ cup Nutella. Arrange rugelach in 8 rows of four on sheet.","Working with few rugelach at a time, brush tops with egg wash, then sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cookies cool completely on sheet, about 20 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "The demerara sugar adds a nice crunch to these rugelach, but they are still great without it. If you have packets of Sugar in the Raw at home, you can use those in place of the demerara. When brushing the rugelach with the egg wash, brush only a few cookies at a time and then sprinkle them with the demerara sugar immediately. If you brush the egg wash onto all the rugelach at once, it will begin to dry by the time you get to the last rugelach, and the sugar won’t stick."
