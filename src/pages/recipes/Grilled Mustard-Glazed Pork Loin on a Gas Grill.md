instructions: ["Heat all burners on high, covered, for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk mustard, jelly, sugar, oil, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper in medium bowl. Reserve one-third of mustard mixture for serving. Coat meat completely with half of remaining mustard mixture.","Scrape and oil cooking grate. Place roast opposite primary burner and grill until well browned all over, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn pork fat-side up, leave primary burner on high, and shut off other burners. Brush roast with one-third of remaining mustard mixture. Cover and cook, brushing with mustard mixture every 10 minutes, until meat registers 140 degrees, 35 to 50 minutes.","Transfer pork to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 15 minutes (temperature should rise to 150 degrees). Pour accumulated juices into reserved mustard mixture and whisk to combine. Cut roast into 1/4-inch slices, transfer to platter, and spoon mustard mixture over top. Serve."]

notes: "Dijon and yellow mustards also work well in the glaze, but make certain to use apple jelly, not apple butter. Look for a pork roast with about 1/4 inch of fat on top and tie the roast at 1-inch intervals to ensure an even shape."
