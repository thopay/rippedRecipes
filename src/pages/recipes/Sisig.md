serves: 16
time: "1¾ hours, plus 12 hours marinating"
instructions: ["Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon liquid seasoning, granulated garlic, onion powder, gochugaru, and salt together in large bowl. Add pork belly and butt and toss to thoroughly combine. Transfer pork and any excess marinade to large zipper-lock bag; seal bag; and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 2 days, turning occasionally.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium-high and turn off other burner(s).","Clean and oil cooking grate. Working with half of pork, cook over hotter side of grill until browned, lightly charred, and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side if using charcoal or 6 minutes per side if using gas, moving pork to cooler side of grill as flare-ups occur. Transfer pork to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pork.","Once pork is cool enough to handle, cut into approximate ¼- to ½-inch pieces. Combine pork, ¼ cup onion, mayonnaise, half of serrano, lemon juice, garlic, and remaining 1½ teaspoons liquid seasoning in bowl. Crack eggs into 3 separate ramekins or small bowls. Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 10 minutes.","Working quickly, add pork mixture to hot skillet, spread into even layer, and make 3 shallow wells for eggs. Sprinkle scallions and remaining ¼ cup onion evenly over pork mixture. Add 1 egg to each well. Sprinkle chicharrones and remaining serrano over top. Garnish with lemon wedges. Bring to table while sizzling. Just before serving, stir to incorporate eggs."]

notes: "This recipe was developed with Datu Puti cane vinegar, but you can use distilled or cider vinegar, if desired. Maggi liquid seasoning can be used in place of the Knorr liquid seasoning. When grilling the pork, you should expect flare-ups to occur, so do not walk away from the grill. Adding the pork to the preheated cast-iron skillet in step 5 will create a decent amount of smoke. Turn on your exhaust fan or crack open a window prior to cooking. This dish is traditionally made with calamansi juice and served with calamansi halves as a garnish. If youre able to find them, use them in place of the lemon juice and lemon wedges. Serve with our Garlic Fried Rice."
