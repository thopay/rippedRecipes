description: "The marriage of smoke and swine may be divine, but rarely does it make for an elegant centerpiece. We wanted big barbecue flavor in a sliceable, dinner party-worthy roast."

serves: 6
time: "2¾ to 3¼ hours, plus 6 hours marinating and 30 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Pat roast dry with paper towels. Using sharp knife, cut ½-inch crosshatch through fat cap, ½ inch deep. Combine 1 teaspoon sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder and rub all over roast, being sure to rub spices into crosshatch. Wrap roast with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours. Just before grilling, soak wood chips in water for 15 minutes, then drain. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely and arrange 3 quarts of unlit charcoal briquettes over half of grill. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over unlit coals. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burners.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Arrange roast meat side up on cool side of grill, with rib bones facing fire. Cook, covered, until pork registers between 90 and 100 degrees, about 1 hour.","Meanwhile, whisk ketchup, juice, remaining sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire, mustard seeds, and hot sauce together in 13 by 9-inch disposable aluminum pan until sugar dissolves. Place pan on grill and move roast to pan with sauce. Spoon sauce over roast. Continue to cook on cool side of grill, covered, basting meat with sauce every 15 minutes, until pork registers 140 degrees, 45 to 75 minutes.","Remove pan from grill, tent roast loosely with foil, and let pork rest in sauce for 30 minutes. Transfer pork to carving board and pour sauce into serving vessel, skimming off fat as necessary. (You should have about 2 cups sauce.) Carve pork in between ribs into thick chops. Serve, passing sauce at table."]

notes: "For easier carving, have the butcher remove the tip of the chine bone and cut the remainder of the chine bone from between the ribs, a technique called scoring. Look for a roast with a 1/4-inch fat cap; if you end up with a thicker fat cap, trim it to 1/4 inch."
