notes: "We developed this recipe using Penzeys Sweet Curry Powder, a mail-order curry powder, which is neither too sweet nor too hot. We call for garam masala in this recipe, but you can omit it and increase the amount of curry powder to 1 teaspoon, if desired. This dish is great served with Raita Sauce."
