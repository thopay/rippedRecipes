Divide meat mixture into six ¼-cup portions. Using your moistened hands, roll portions into 1½-inch meatballs. Transfer to plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use. (Meatballs can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Combine oil and garlic in large saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is softened and golden on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Nestle meatballs into sauce and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; cover; and cook until meatballs are cooked through and tender, 20 to 25 minutes, flipping meatballs halfway through cooking.","Uncover saucepan and stir in 1 tablespoon basil.
