instructions: ["FOR THE COOKIES: Whisk almond flour, orange zest, coffee, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and salt together in bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add sugar and whip until glossy, soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Whip in almond and vanilla extracts.","Fold almond flour mixture into whipped whites in 2 additions until few white streaks remain. Fold in marmalade until no white streaks remain. Divide dough in half and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.","FOR THE TOPPING: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 300 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk egg whites in shallow dish until frothy. Place almonds in second shallow dish.","Divide 1 dough half into 20 pieces. On lightly floured counter, roll each piece into 5-inch rope, shape into circle, and press ends together to seal. Dip 1 side of each wreath into egg whites, letting excess drip off, then press gently into almonds. Place, almond side up, on prepared sheets (10 cookies per sheet). Press 4 cherry pieces into each wreath.","Bake until firm and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough, egg whites, almonds, and cherries, letting sheets cool between batches. Dust with confectioners’ sugar before serving."]
