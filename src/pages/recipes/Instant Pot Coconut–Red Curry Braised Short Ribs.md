serves: 6
time: "1½ hours"
instructions: ["Pat ribs dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Using highest saute function, heat oil in Instant Pot for 3 to 5 minutes (or until just smoking). Add half of ribs. Cook until well browned all over, 8 to 10 minutes, then transfer ribs to plate. Repeat with remaining ribs.","Add ginger and garlic to now-empty Instant Pot and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in flour and continue to cook 30 seconds longer. Whisk in coconut milk, curry paste, sugar, and fish sauce until smooth, scraping up any browned bits. Return ribs and accumulated juices to pot. Lock lid into place and close pressure-release valve. Select high pressure-cook function and cook for 45 minutes.","Turn off Instant Pot and let pressure release gradually for 15 minutes. Quick-release any remaining pressure. Carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Transfer ribs to shallow serving platter and tent with aluminum foil. Let sauce settle in pot for 5 minutes to allow fat to separate.","Using ladle or large spoon, skim fat off top of sauce. Stir lime juice into sauce, then pour over ribs. Sprinkle with scallions and serve."]

notes: "We developed this recipe using Thai Kitchen brand red curry paste. Our favorite fish sauce is Red Boat 40°N Fish Sauce. Coconut milk can separate in its can during storage, so its important to stir it before measuring to make sure that it is fully emulsified. Serve with rice."
