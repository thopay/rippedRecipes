ingredients: ["1 medium head, cauliflower (about 2 pounds)","1/4 cup, extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling",", Kosher salt and ground black pepper"]
serves: 6
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Trim outer leaves of cauliflower and cut stem flush with bottom. Cut head into 8 equal wedges so that core and florets remain intact (see photo). Place wedges cut side down on foil- or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; gently rub to evenly distribute oil and seasonings. Gently flip cauliflower and season other cut side with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and pepper.","Cover baking sheet tightly with foil and cook for 10 minutes. Remove foil and continue to roast until bottoms of cauliflower pieces are golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove sheet from oven, and, using spatula, carefully flip wedges. Return sheet to oven and continue to roast until cauliflower is golden all over, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste, drizzle with oil (or sauce), and serve immediately."]

notes: "This dish stands well on its own, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil, or with our Sherry Vinegar-Honey Sauce, Curry-Yogurt Sauce, or Soy-Ginger Sauce. Also, some tasters liked spiced versions made with either curry powder or chili powder. Simply stir 2 teaspoons of either spice into the oil before seasoning the cauliflower in step 1."
