time: "1¼ hours, plus 1 hour cooling (if using frosting)"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 8-inch baking dish with foil and coat foil with cooking spray.","Melt chocolate and butter in small bowl in microwave or in heatproof bowl set over pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally to combine. Cool mixture for several minutes.","Whisk sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, and vanilla together in medium bowl until combined, about 15 seconds. Whisk in chocolate mixture until smooth. Stir in flour until no streaks of flour remain. Scrape batter evenly into prepared pan. Drop peanut butter in 10 small dollops over batter. Without touching foil lining, run paring knife through batter to create swirls.","Bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center of pan comes out clean, 22 to 27 minutes. Cool brownies on wire rack for 1 hour.","Using foil, lift brownies from pan to cutting board. Slide foil out from under brownies and cut brownies into 2-inch squares. (Brownies can be stored in airtight container for several days.)","For the frosting (optional): Heat chocolate and oil in microwave or in bowl set over pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth. Cool until barely warm, about 5 minutes. Pour chocolate mixture over brownies and spread evenly with spatula. Continue cooling brownies until glaze sets, 1 to 2 hours. Cut brownies as directed."]

notes: "These brownies are moist and packed with chocolate flavor, but they wont crumble when you cut them. In fact, they hold up well enough to pack in a childs lunchbox or bring to a picnic or bake sale. Theyre pretty good at home, too, with a tall glass of milk. Use either creamy or chunky peanut butter, but avoid old-fashioned brands with oil on top. To gild the lily, cover these brownies with chocolate frosting (see optional recipe below)."
