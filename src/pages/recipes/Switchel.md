notes: "This recipe can be easily doubled. Do not substitute pancake syrup for the maple syrup. Use a rasp grater for the ginger and the lemon zest. The longer you let the switchel chill before straining, the stronger the ginger flavor will be. Feel free to adjust the tartness with water to suit your taste."
