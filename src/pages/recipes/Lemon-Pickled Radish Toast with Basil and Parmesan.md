instructions: ["Place radishes in medium bowl or large measuring cup. Bring lemon juice, ¼ cup water, sugar, and table salt to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Pour lemon juice mixture over radishes. Let radishes sit in pickling liquid for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally; drain radishes and refrigerate until ready to serve. (Pickled radishes can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Meanwhile, process cream cheese, ¼ cup Parmesan, ¼ cup basil, garlic, and lemon zest in food processor until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer to bowl. (Cream cheese mixture can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Let come to room temperature before using.)","Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over toast.

notes: "We prefer to slice the radishes using a mandoline, but you can also use a knife. The pickling liquid might not fully cover the radishes at first; they will shrink significantly as they pickle. Be sure to drain the radishes after 30 minutes or they will become too soft. We developed this recipe using a round boule, but any rustic, crusty bread will work. Cut into four pieces each, these toasts make excellent party snacks."
