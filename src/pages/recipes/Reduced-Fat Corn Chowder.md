Whisk flour into corn liquid until no lumps remain.","Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; add onion, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper; and cook, covered, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add corn liquid mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened to paste-like consistency, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in broth until incorporated. Cook until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.","Add milk, potatoes, thyme, and bay leaf and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 7 minutes. Add remaining 3¾ cups corn and half-and-half and return to simmer. Simmer until kernels are tender yet firm, 10 to 12 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

notes: "Don’t substitute frozen corn for fresh. Because it’s parcooked, frozen corn won’t release the starchy liquid that flavors and thickens our soup."
