notes: "We prefer to use day-old bread for this recipe because it is easier to slice. The crostini are best topped shortly before serving. Our preferred brand of whole-milk ricotta is BelGioioso Ricotta con Latte Whole Milk. A 12-inch demi-baguette will easily yield the 24 slices needed for this recipe."
