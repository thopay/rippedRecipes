Pat stalks dry with paper towels if still wet.","Combine sesame oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes in small bowl. Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking.

notes: "Bok choy can sometimes be sandy near the inner base of the head. Look for this sand when youre separating the stalks and make sure to remove it during rinsing. Look for heads of bok choy that weigh 4 to 6 ounces each."
