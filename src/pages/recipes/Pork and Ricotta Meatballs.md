instructions: ["FOR THE MEATBALLS: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and spray evenly with vegetable oil spray. Combine bread and ricotta in large bowl and let sit, mashing occasionally with fork, until smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes.","Add pork, Parmesan, parsley, eggs, shallots, garlic, salt, pepper, and lemon zest to bread mixture and mix with your hands until thoroughly combined. Divide meat mixture into 24 portions (about 1/4 cup each) and place on platter. Roll meat between your wet hands to form meatballs and space evenly on prepared wire rack. Roast meatballs until browned, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through roasting. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.","FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, combine oil and garlic in Dutch oven set over low heat and cook until garlic is soft and golden on all sides, 12 to 14 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover, with lid slightly ajar, and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Nestle meatballs into sauce, cover, and transfer pot to oven. Bake until meatballs are tender and sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. Transfer meatballs and sauce to serving platter. Sprinkle with basil and serve, passing extra Parmesan separately."]

notes: "It takes about 10 minutes of occasional mashing with a fork for the ricotta to fully wet the bread enough for the panade to achieve the desired paste consistency. Use a greased 1/4-cup dry measuring cup or equal-size portion scoop to divvy up the meatballs, and use slightly wet hands when shaping them to minimize sticking. This recipe makes enough sauce to coat 1 1/2 pounds of pasta."
