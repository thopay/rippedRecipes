Stir in flour, thyme, and allspice and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add leftover meat, vegetables, and broth and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and mash with potato masher until mixture is coarsely mashed. Season with salt and pepper. Cool completely.","ASSEMBLE PASTIES Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut each dough round in half. Arrange one-quarter of filling on one side of each half, leaving 1-inch border around edges. Brush edges of dough with water, fold over filling, and crimp edges to seal. (At this point, pasties can be refrigerated for up to 12 hours.) Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Cut 3 vent holes in top of each pasty and bake until golden, about 25 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and cool 15 minutes. Serve."]
