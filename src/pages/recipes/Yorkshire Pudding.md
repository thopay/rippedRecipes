serves: 8
time: "1½ hours, plus 1 hour resting"
instructions: ["RENDER PORK Cook salt pork, covered, in medium saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and salt pork is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Discard pork and pour off fat from pan, reserving 4 tablespoons. Let cool slightly. (Rendered fat can be refrigerated in airtight container for 3 days. Microwave until melted and cool slightly before proceeding.)","MAKE BATTER Combine flour and salt in large bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, and 2 tablespoons reserved fat in medium bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk milk mixture into flour mixture until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. (Alternatively, batter can be refrigerated, covered, for 1 day. Bring to room temperature before proceeding with recipe.)","BAKE Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Divide remaining fat between two 8-inch square baking pans. Transfer pans to oven and heat until fat is just smoking, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk batter and pour half (about 1 3/4 cups) into center of each prepared pan. Bake until golden brown and edges are crisp, about 25 minutes. With skewer, poke small hole in center of each pudding and continue to bake until deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer puddings to cutting board and cut into squares. Serve."]

notes: "Look for salt pork that is fatty rather than meaty. If you dont have two 8-inch square baking pans, you can use two 9-inch round cake pans. (Just dont use temperature-sensitive glass baking dishes, which can crack in the high heat.) Leave about 3 inches of space between the pans in the oven to allow the air to circulate and cook the puddings evenly."
