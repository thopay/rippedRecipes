time: "1Â¾ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Trim pork, leaving 1/4-inch-thick layer of fat on top. Pat pork dry with paper towels, then tie with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Season pork with salt and pepper and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon thyme. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown pork on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes, reducing heat if pot begins to scorch. Transfer pork to plate.","Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, onion, barley, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to now-empty pot. Cook until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and remaining 1 tablespoon thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and cook until evaporated, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and bring to simmer.","Off heat, return browned pork and any accumulated juices to pot. Place large sheet of aluminum foil over pot and press to seal, then cover tightly with lid. Transfer pot to oven and cook until center of pork registers 135 degrees, 25 to 35 minutes.","Remove pot from oven. Transfer pork to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest while barley and vegetables finish cooking.","Meanwhile, transfer pot to stovetop and simmer over medium-low heat, covered, until barley is just cooked through but still somewhat firm in center, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in squash and chard stems and cook, covered, until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in chard leaves, increase heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, until leaves are tender and mixture is thickened to risotto-like consistency, 2 to 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in Parmesan and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Discard twine and slice pork. Serve with barley and vegetables."]

notes: "Arrowhead Mills and Quaker pearl barley yield the most consistent results in this recipe. If you use a different brand, you may need to extend the cooking time in step 5, adding water as necessary. Use a large Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. Look for a 3-pound pork loin roast that is 7 to 8 inches long and 4 to 5 inches wide."
