instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spread cornbread evenly over two baking sheets. Bake until slightly crisp, 15 to 20 minutes; cool. Using oven mitts, remove upper-middle rack from oven.","Lightly brown sausage in Dutch oven over medium-high heat, 5 to 7 minutes, and transfer to plate lined with paper towels. After pouring off residual fat in pot, melt butter, add onions and celery, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in sage, garlic, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth and sausage to pot and scrape bottom with wooden spoon to release any browned bits. Add cornbread and gently stir until liquid is absorbed.

Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before baking.)","Uncover Dutch oven and bake until top of stuffing is golden brown and crisp, about 30 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "Spicy andouille sausage from Louisiana is the test kitchen’s favorite in this recipe, but chorizo or kielbasa work well, too. For the cornbread, try our recipe at www.cookscountry.com or use your own."
