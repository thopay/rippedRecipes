notes: "Berbere is a warmly aromatic and highly flavorful Ethiopian and Eritrean spice blend. If you cant find it, you can substitute Old Bay, jerk seasoning, or garam masala, but the flavor profile of your drinks wont be the same. The type of horseradish you choose can greatly impact your cocktail; we suggest using a good-quality refrigerated prepared horseradish such as Woebers Pure Horseradish. Passata is an uncooked tomato puree usually found near the other tomato products in the grocery store. You can garnish the Bloody Marys with anything you like, such as candied bacon, pickled vegetables, or salami and cheese skewers. (See Garnish Ideas for some of our favorite combinations.)"
