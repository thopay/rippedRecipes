serves: 10
time: "2¾ hours, plus 4½ hours marinating and resting"
instructions: ["Combine 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, thyme, 4 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, rosemary, lemon zest, coriander, cumin, paprika, pepper flakes, and cinnamon in bowl.","Place lamb fat side up on cutting board and trim away nearly all excess fat and sinew. (After trimming, lamb should weigh approximately 3½ to 3¾ pounds.) Flip lamb fat side down and butterfly thicker parts to make leg approximately same thickness throughout. Cut five ½-inch-deep slashes in exposed surface of lamb to create slits for herb paste to cling to.","Rub herb paste all over slashed side of lamb. Turn lamb so short side is parallel to edge of counter, then roll tightly away from you into compact roast. Using 6 or 7 pieces of kitchen twine, tie lamb crosswise at equal intervals. Sprinkle exterior of lamb with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remaining 1 teaspoon pepper.","Wrap lamb tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sear lamb on all sides until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.","Off heat, flip lamb seam side up. Add wine to skillet (it should come to quick boil from residual heat). Transfer skillet to oven and roast for 30 minutes.","Remove skillet from oven and flip lamb seam side down. Insert temperature probe into center of lamb. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast until lamb registers 130 to 135 degrees, about 1 hour longer. Transfer lamb to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest for 30 minutes.","Just before carving lamb, bring pan juices to boil over medium heat and reduce by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and swirl in butter until melted and combined. Remove sauce from heat and cover to keep warm. Remove twine and slice lamb thin. Serve lamb with sauce."]

notes: "Some boneless legs of lamb come wrapped in netting. Ask your butcher if it’s a single piece or a jumbled mix of multiple chunks; you want one single piece. If you can’t find a 4½- to 4¾-pound boneless leg, you can ask your butcher to break down a 6¼-pound bone-in leg for you. We prefer using a temperature probe here to avoid opening the oven, but you can also use an instant-read thermometer. If using an instant-read thermometer, be sure to check the lamb in multiple places; you want the lowest temperatures to range from 130 to 135 degrees."
