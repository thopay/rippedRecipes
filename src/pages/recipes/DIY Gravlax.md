Flip bag and spread remaining half of salt mixture over bottom of salmon (salmon should be well coated all over). Press out air and seal bag.","Place bag on large plate or rimmed baking sheet, making sure salmon sits flat. Place square baking dish filled with 2 large, heavy cans on top of bag. Refrigerate for 3 days, flipping bag once each day.","Remove gravlax from salt mixture; discard salt mixture. Rinse gravlax well with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. To serve, slice gravlax in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise on bias as thin as possible with sharp knife. (Gravlax can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 3 days.)"]
