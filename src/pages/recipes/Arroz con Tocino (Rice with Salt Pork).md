instructions: ["Cook salt pork and oil in large saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until pork is browned and fat has rendered, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until edges of grains are translucent, about 2 minutes.","Stir in water and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until liquid falls below surface of rice and rice is dotted with small bubbling holes, 7 to 10 minutes.","Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 17 minutes. Off heat, let rice rest, covered, for at least 10 minutes. Check to ensure rice is fully cooked; if rice is slightly underdone, let sit, covered, until fully tender, 5 to 10 minutes longer.

notes: "This old-school twist on classic white rice pairs particularly well with Habichuelas Guisadas con Calabaza. Salt pork can vary in saltiness and funk, so rinse it well and pat it dry with a clean towel before dicing, and adjust the salt to taste. If you cant find salt pork, you can substitute diced thick-cut bacon. Any short-grain white rice will work here; we developed this recipe with sushi rice. Do not rinse the rice before cooking as it will retain moisture and become mushy."
