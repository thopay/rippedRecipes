Remove 2 tablespoons cranberries and set aside in refrigerator. Add pears, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt to remaining cranberries in saucepan and cook over medium heat until pears are very soft and almost all liquid has evaporated, about 45 minutes, stirring frequently and reducing heat as needed if bottom begins to scorch. Transfer fruit mixture to food processor and process until smooth, 30 to 45 seconds (you should have 2 1/2 cups puree). Transfer to bowl, press parchment paper on top, and refrigerate until completely cool, about 4 hours.","FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray with flour and line with parchment. Pour 8 ounces (about 1 cup) batter into each pan and spread into even layer. Bake until tops are set and edges are just starting to brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove cakes from pans and let cool completely on wire rack (leaving parchment on cakes). Wipe pans clean and repeat process twice more, for a total of 6 cake layers.","TO ASSEMBLE: Gently remove parchment and place 1 cake round on cake plate or pedestal. Spread 1/2 cup puree in even layer over cake. Repeat with remaining cake layers and remaining puree, leaving top of cake plain. Spread whipped cream in even layer over top of cake.
