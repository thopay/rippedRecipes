notes: "Two small brioche rolls should yield the 4 ounces needed for this recipe. For a less spicy dish, substitute regular pork sausage for the hot. We like the sweetness that maple syrup adds here, but you can omit it for a more savory strata. If you dont have an 8-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet, cook the sausage in a 10-inch skillet and assemble and bake the strata in a greased 9-inch pie plate."
