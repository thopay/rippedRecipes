notes: "We developed this recipe using Bob’s Red Mill Organic Farro. You can also use whole-grain or semipearled farro here if you can find it, but note that the cooking time will be on the longer side of the range given. To use whole-grain farro, soak it for at least 8 hours or up to 12 hours and drain it thoroughly before starting with step 1. Do not use quick-cooking farro here. To cut the cooling time in step 3 in half, you can spread the farro over a rimmed baking sheet. This recipe was inspired by the Spring Salad with Asparagus Coins, Kamut, and Lemon Vinaigrette in Simply Ancient Grains (2015) by Maria Speck."
