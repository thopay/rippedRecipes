notes: "For this recipe, we like using jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), but extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound) work as well, although you will need more skewers and the cooking time will be about 1½ minutes per side. We prefer untreated shrimp—those not treated with salt or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate. Most frozen E-Z peel shrimp have been treated (the ingredient list should tell you). If youre using treated shrimp, reduce the salt in the mayonnaise mixture to ¼ teaspoon."
