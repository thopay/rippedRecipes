notes: "For less spice, remove some or all of the seeds and ribs from the jalapenos. You can substitute plain whole-milk yogurt for the sour cream, if desired. If youre breaking down the chicken yourself, a 4-pound whole chicken will yield the 3 pounds of pieces called for in the recipe. If you dont have a broiler-safe 12-inch skillet, you can use a broiler-safe 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Plan ahead: The chicken needs to marinate for at least 1 hour before it is cooked."
