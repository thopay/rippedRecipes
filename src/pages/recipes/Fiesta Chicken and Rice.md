instructions: ["Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook chicken until golden brown on one side, about 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate, leaving fat in pan.","Add rice, onion, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until grains are sizzling and toasted and onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes (reduce heat if rice browns too quickly).

Stir rice, replace cover, and continue cooking until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Slice chicken breasts into 1/2-inch pieces.","Remove skillet from heat. Arrange sliced chicken on top of rice and sprinkle with cheese and scallions. Cover and let stand until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Serve."]
