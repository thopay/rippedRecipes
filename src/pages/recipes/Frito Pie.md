notes: "If you cant find 85 percent lean ground beef, you can use 80 percent. We prefer the flavor of Pacifico or other Mexican lagers in this chili, but if they are unavailable, Budweiser or another mild lager will work just fine. Do not use bolder beers, which can make the chili too bitter. For a milder chili, use the smaller quantity of chipotle. We developed this recipe with original flavor Fritos corn chips. You can assemble and eat the Frito pie right out of the bag, or you can portion Fritos (2 to 4 ounces per serving) and chili (½ cup to 1 cup per serving) into individual serving bowls. This recipe will serve six as a meal or 12 as a snack or as part of a larger spread."
