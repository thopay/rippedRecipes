serves: 40
time: "1¾ hours, plus 1 hour cooling and 3 hours chilling"
instructions: ["FOR THE FILLING: Combine all ingredients in small saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to bowl and let cool completely, about 1 hour.","FOR THE DOUGH: Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat brown sugar, granulated sugar, and butter on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined. Add vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture in 3 additions, and mix until just combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Divide dough in half and form each half into 6-inch square. Wrap squares in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 2 days.","Working on floured parchment paper, roll 1 dough square into 13 by 9-inch rectangle. Spread half of cooled filling evenly over dough. With long side facing you, use parchment to roll dough into log. Wrap tightly with parchment and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and grease parchment. Working with 1 log at a time, slice dough into ½-inch-thick rounds and space them 2 inches apart on prepared sheets. Bake until tops are golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through. Slide parchment onto wire rack and let cookies cool completely before serving. Repeat with second dough log. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "Plan ahead: The dough needs time to chill twice. And don’t forget to grease the parchment paper—otherwise, these soft cookies will stick."
