instructions: ["FOR THE CITY CHICKEN: Combine salt, garlic powder, pepper, thyme, and cayenne in medium bowl. Add pork and toss to coat thoroughly with spice mixture. Thread pork onto 8 (6-inch) bamboo skewers (6 to 8 pieces per skewer). (Skewers can be prepared up to 24 hours in advance.)","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Place wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Place flour in shallow dish. Whisk eggs and water together in second shallow dish. Place panko in third shallow dish. Working with 1 skewer at a time, dredge in flour, dip in egg, then coat with panko, pressing to adhere.","Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat to 350 degrees. Working with 4 skewers at a time, fry first side until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip skewers and continue to fry until golden brown on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining skewers. Transfer to oven and bake until pork is tender, about 1 hour. Place skewers on platter and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.","FOR THE SOUR CREAM-DILL SAUCE: Meanwhile, whisk all ingredients together in bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve sauce with skewers."]

notes: "You will need eight (6-inch) bamboo skewers. If you can’t find them, trim longer ones or the skewered meat won’t fit in the pot for frying. Pork butt roast may be labeled Boston butt. You can make the sauce and trim, season, and skewer the meat a day in advance."
