serves: 6
time: "2 hours"
instructions: ["Combine flour, chives, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in bowl. Form well in center and add beaten eggs. Using fork, slowly work flour into eggs, using your hands when stirring becomes difficult. (Dough will be very firm.) Knead dough on lightly floured counter until smooth, about 1 minute. Return dough to bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature while assembling soup.","Cut kernels from 2 ears corn, transfer to bowl, and reserve cobs. Grate remaining 2 ears corn on large holes of box grater over same bowl; reserve cobs.","Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add broth, chicken thighs, and reserved cobs and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. Add chicken breast and continue to simmer until breast registers 160 degrees, about 20 minutes longer.","Remove pot from heat; discard cobs. Transfer chicken to plate and let cool slightly. Pinch off pea-size pieces of dough and drop into soup. Stir in corn kernel mixture and bring soup to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until corn is just tender, about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep rivels from sticking to bottom of pot.","Using 2 forks, shred chicken into bite-size pieces; discard bones. Stir shredded chicken into soup and cook until warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, topped with hardcooked eggs."]

notes: "Fresh corn kernels (plus the stripped cobs) give this soup its flavor; do not substitute frozen corn. Our favorite store-bought broth is Swanson Chicken Stock. Note that the chicken thighs and breast are added to the soup at different points. This soup cooks for about 90 minutes."
