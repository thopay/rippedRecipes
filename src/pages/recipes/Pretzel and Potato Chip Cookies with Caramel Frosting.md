instructions: ["FOR THE COOKIES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, ½ cup sugar, vanilla, and salt on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add flour in 3 additions, scraping down bowl as needed. Stir in potato chips and pretzels.","Place remaining ¼ cup sugar in shallow dish. Working with 1 heaping tablespoon dough at a time, roll into 24 balls. Roll balls in sugar to coat and space them 2 inches apart on prepared sheets. Press dough to 1/4-inch thickness using bottom of greased measuring cup.","Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until set and edges are golden, about 15 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cookies cool completely before frosting.","FOR THE FROSTING: Bring brown sugar, cream, butter, and salt to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Transfer to bowl and let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Whisk in confectioners’ sugar. Spread 1 teaspoon frosting on tops of each cookie. Sprinkle cookies with pecans and let stand until frosting is set, about 30 minutes. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]
