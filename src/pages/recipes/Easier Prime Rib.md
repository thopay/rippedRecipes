Record that number; this will be your oven-on roasting time in minutes.","Pat prime rib dry with paper towels. Brush all over with mustard. Sprinkle salt and pepper mixture evenly on all sides. Transfer to prepared wire rack, fat side up.","Transfer sheet with prime rib to oven and roast for time recorded in step 2. Without opening oven door, turn off oven and leave roast in oven, undisturbed, for 2 hours. Do not open oven during this time.","Remove sheet from oven and let prime rib rest on rack for 20 minutes.

notes: "You can substitute other complementary spices for the pepper, if desired. It is critical that you not open the oven door at all while the roast is cooking. If you do, the heat will escape from the oven and the calculated cooking time will be ineffective. It’s good to use an oven thermometer to ensure that your oven truly reaches 500 degrees before starting. See “Cooking Time Cheat Sheet for Medium-Rare Meat” for help calculating the correct oven time for your particular prime rib. You can serve with Prepared Horseradish.&nbsp;"
