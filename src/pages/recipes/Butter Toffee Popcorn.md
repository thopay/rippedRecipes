Add brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.

(Popcorn can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for 5 days.)"]

notes: "It stores well and makes a nice gift packed in a decorative tin. If you don’t have a large roasting pan, bake the popcorn in a large disposable aluminum pan. Avoid popcorn with heavy butter seasoning."
