instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 pulses. Add butter and pulse until reduced to pea-size pieces, 10 to 12 pulses.","Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add milk and stir with rubber spatula until shaggy dough forms. Turn out dough onto heavily floured counter and knead until dough comes together fully and feels smooth, with few small butter flecks still visible, 8 to 10 turns.","Roll dough into 11-inch circle about ½ inch thick. Using 2-inch biscuit cutter dipped in flour, cut 22 to 23 rounds from dough. Reroll scraps once to similar thickness and cut out 5 to 6 more rounds to yield 28 biscuits. Space biscuits evenly on prepared baking sheet (7 rows of 4). Prick each biscuit 3 times with tines of fork.","Bake until tops are light golden brown, 27 to 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let biscuits cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature."]
