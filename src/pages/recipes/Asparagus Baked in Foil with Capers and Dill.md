instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with 16 by 12-inch sheet of aluminum foil.","Arrange asparagus in center of foil with spears running parallel to short side of sheet, leaving 1½-inch border between bottom of spears and edge of foil. Sprinkle butter, shallot, garlic, salt, and pepper evenly over asparagus.","Place second 16 by 12-inch sheet of foil over asparagus. Starting with 1 edge, pinch sheets together and fold foil in toward center by ½ inch. Repeat folding 1 or 2 times to create tight seal. Continue folding remaining 3 edges of foil to create tightly sealed packet.","Transfer sheet to oven and cook for 18 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and let asparagus continue to steam in unopened packet 5 minutes longer (if using slightly thicker or thinner asparagus, increase or decrease this resting time by 2 minutes).","Using scissors or paring knife, carefully cut open top of packet, allowing steam to escape away from you. Sprinkle asparagus with capers, dill, and lemon juice. Toss gently with tongs to combine. Using tongs, transfer asparagus to serving platter, then pour sauce from packet over top and serve. (Alternatively, serve directly from packet.)"]
