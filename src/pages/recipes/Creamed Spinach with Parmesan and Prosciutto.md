description: "Creamed spinach is a classic steakhouse side dish of chopped fresh spinach in a rich, cheesy cream sauce. We wanted to avoid the fate of gray, stringy spinach in a stodgy, heavy sauce that befalls most recipes."

time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook half of prosciutto until lightly browned and crisp, about 5 minutes; transfer to paper towel-lined plate. Add spinach to pot in handfuls, stirring to allow each batch to wilt slightly before adding next. Continue to cook until spinach is uniformly wilted and glossy, about 1 minute. Transfer spinach to colander set over bowl and press with wooden spoon to release extra liquid.","Wipe out Dutch oven and melt remaining butter over medium heat. Add onion, remaining prosciutto, and sage and cook until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and nutmeg and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Whisk in milk and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 3 minutes.","Return spinach to pot and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl, sprinkle with remaining Parmesan, and top with crispy prosciutto. Serve."]

notes: "While three 9-ounce boxes of frozen leaf spinach (defrosted and squeezed dry) may be substituted for the fresh, avoid baby spinach—it becomes slimy once cooked. Be sure to press as much liquid as possible from the spinach in step 1."
