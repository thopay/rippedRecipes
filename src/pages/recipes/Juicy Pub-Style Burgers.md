instructions: ["Place steak on baking sheet in single layer. Freeze steak until very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, about 35 minutes.","Place one-quarter of steak in food processor and pulse until finely ground into 1/16-inch pieces, about 35 pulses, stopping to redistribute around bowl as necessary to ensure meat is evenly ground. Transfer meat to second baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 3 batches of steak. Spread meat over sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat or fat.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Drizzle butter over ground meat and add 1 teaspoon pepper. Gently toss with fork to combine. Divide meat into 4 lightly packed balls. Gently flatten into patties 3/4 inch thick and about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. (Patties can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 1 day.)","Season 1 side of patties liberally with salt and pepper. Using spatula, flip patties and season other side. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Using spatula, transfer burgers to skillet and cook without moving them for 2 minutes. Using spatula, flip burgers and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer patties to rimmed baking sheet. Bake until burgers register 125 degrees for medium-rare or 130 degrees for medium, 3 to 6 minutes.","Transfer burgers to plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Transfer to buns and serve."]

notes: "Sirloin steak tips are also sold as flap meat. You will need to freeze the meat for 35 minutes before processing it. Be gentle when shaping the patties, taking care not to overwork the meat so the burgers won’t become dense. Serve with your favorite toppings."
