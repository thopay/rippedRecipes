instructions: ["Toss pork cubes with salt and pepper; set aside. Fry bacon in large, heavy soup kettle or Dutch oven over medium heat until fat renders and bacon crisps, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with slotted spoon to plate lined with paper towels; pour all but 2 teaspoons fat from pot into small bowl; set aside.","Using the pot and a skillet, Increase heat to medium-high, add a quarter of meat to the pot and pan and cook until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned meat to bowl. Brown remaining meat, adding another 2 teaspoons bacon fat to the pot or pan if necessary. Transfer second batch of meat to bowl. Use one cup of the water to deglaze the skillet. Reserve this liquid.","Reduce heat to medium-low and add 3 tablespoons bacon fat to the pot. Add onion, jalapenos, chili powder, cumin, and oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are beginning to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and brown sugar; cook until just fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add diced tomatoes and scrape pot bottom to loosen browned bits. Add reserved bacon, browned pork, water, and reserved water from the deglazed skillet; bring to simmer. Continue to cook, uncovered, at slow simmer until meat is tender and juices are dark and starting to thicken, about 2 hours.","Add beans, reduce heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

notes: "For spicier chili, boost the heat with a pinch of cayenne or a dash of hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco. This chili tastes even better when made a day in advance. If you plan to serve it the next day, dont add the beans unitl you have reheated the chili--this will keep them nice and firm. Good choices for condiments include diced fresh tomatoes, lime wedges, diced avocado, sliced scallions,  chopped red onion, chopped cilantro leaves, sour cream, and shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese. If you try to brown four batches of the meat in the same pan, the drippings will burn. We recommended that you brown the extra meat (in two batches) in a separate skillet."
