serves: 16
time: "1 hour, plus 12 hours chilling"
instructions: ["Place 2 small plates in freezer to chill. Combine rhubarb, sugar, and lemon juice in Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until rhubarb is softened, about 5 minutes. Using potato masher, crush rhubarb gently, leaving some larger pieces intact. Simmer vigorously, stirring often and adjusting heat as needed to avoid scorching and splattering, until mixture is reduced by about half and registers 215 degrees, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat.","To test consistency, place 1 teaspoon jam on chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes. Drag your finger through jam on plate; jam has correct consistency when your finger leaves distinct trail. Off heat, stir in ¾ teaspoon ground cardamom and ½ teaspoon pepper. If jam is runny, return pot to heat and continue to simmer 1 to 3 minutes longer before retesting with second plate.","Place 2 pint jars in bowl and place under hot running water until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes; shake dry.","Using funnel and ladle, portion hot jam into hot jars. Let jam cool completely; cover; and refrigerate until jam is set, 12 to 24 hours. (Jam can be refrigerated for up to 2 months.)"]

notes: "Depending on the amount of trimming required, you may need more than 2 pounds of rhubarb to get 7 cups of cut pieces. In addition to sweet applications, this jam is great on a cheese board or added to a glaze for pork or duck."
