ingredients: ["3 2/3 cups (20⅛ ounces), bread flour","1 tablespoon, instant or rapid-rise yeast","1 1/4 cups (10 ounces), water, room temperature","2 , large eggs, plus 1 large egg, lightly beaten","1/4 cup (1¾ ounces), sugar","2 1/2 teaspoons, table salt","14 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 14 pieces and softened, divided"]
serves: 24
time: "1¾ hours, plus 2 hours rising"
instructions: ["Whisk flour and yeast together in bowl of stand mixer. Add room-temperature water and 2 eggs. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until dough comes together and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl and dough hook frequently. Turn off mixer, cover bowl with dish towel or plastic wrap, and let dough stand for 15 minutes.","Add sugar and salt to dough and knead on medium-low speed until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and, with mixer running, add 13 tablespoons butter 1 piece at a time, allowing each piece to incorporate before adding next, about 3 minutes total, scraping down bowl and dough hook as needed. Continue to knead on medium speed until dough is elastic and pulls away cleanly from sides of bowl, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer dough to greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.","Grease 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Turn out dough onto counter and divide into twenty-four 1½-ounce portions; divide any remaining dough evenly among portions. Working with 1 dough portion at a time, cup dough with your palm and roll against counter into smooth, tight ball. Place dough balls in prepared pan in 6 rows of four.","Cover loosely with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.","Discard plastic and brush tops of dough balls with beaten egg (you do not need to use all of it). Bake until rolls are deep golden brown and register 205 to 210 degrees in center, about 25 minutes. Let rolls cool in pan for 15 minutes, then transfer rolls to wire rack and brush with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Serve warm. (Rolls can be stored in zipper-lock bags at room temperature for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)","To make ahead: After covering pan with plastic wrap in step 4, refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Let rolls sit at room temperature for 2 hours before proceeding with recipe; increase baking time by 5 minutes."]

notes: "All-purpose flour can be substituted for the bread flour, but the rolls wont be as tall; use the same amount of all-purpose flour by weight, not by volume. When kneading the dough on medium speed, the mixer may wobble on the counter. Watch it closely and place a dish towel or shelf liner underneath it to keep it in place."
