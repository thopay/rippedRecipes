serves: 2
time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["FOR THE GRITS: Bring water and salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Slowly whisk in grits to ensure no lumps form. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, whisking frequently and scraping sides and bottom of saucepan to make sure grits do not stick, until grits are tender and have consistency of thick pancake batter, 20 to 25 minutes.","Off heat, whisk cheddar, cream, and pepper into grits until fully combined. Cover to keep warm.","FOR THE SHRIMP AND SAUCE: Sprinkle shrimp with Louisiana seasoning and set aside. Melt butter in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add andouille and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.","Add scallion whites and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cream and shrimp and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through and sauce is slightly thickened, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in hot sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste.","If grits have set, whisk in extra hot water, a little at a time, until creamy; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve shrimp and sauce over grits, sprinkled with scallion greens, passing lemon wedges and extra hot sauce separately."]

notes: "Jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound) will also work in this recipe, although you may need to increase the cooking time in step 4 by a minute or so. We prefer shrimp not treated with sodium or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate (the ingredient list should tell you). If youre using treated shrimp, reduce the Louisiana seasoning to ¾ teaspoon."
