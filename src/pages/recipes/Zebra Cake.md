instructions: ["FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line with parchment paper. Whisk cocoa and boiling water in medium bowl until smooth; let cool for 15 minutes. Transfer half of cake batter to bowl with cocoa mixture and stir gently to combine. Spoon 3 tablespoons chocolate batter into each prepared pan and spread into 3-inch circle. Top with 3 tablespoons yellow batter; gently press into chocolate batter without intentionally swirling batters. Repeat, alternating batters, ending with remaining chocolate batter. Gently shake pans to even out batter but do not spread batter. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans for 3 minutes; using thin knife, loosen cakes from sides of pans. Invert cakes onto large plates, discard parchment, then reinvert onto lightly greased wire rack. Let cakes cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.","TO ASSEMBLE: Place 1 cake layer on cake plate or pedestal and spread evenly with 1 cup frosting. Invert second layer and place on top. Frost top and sides with remaining 3 cups frosting. Melt chocolate in microwave and transfer to zipper-lock bag. Cut small hole in corner of bag and pipe chocolate in zigzag pattern across top of cake. Serve."]
