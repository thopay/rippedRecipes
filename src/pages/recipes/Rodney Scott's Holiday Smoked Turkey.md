serves: 12
time: "4¾ hours, plus 30 minutes resting"
instructions: ["FOR THE MOP: Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Discard lemon slices. (Mop can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 2 months.)","FOR THE RUB: Combine all ingredients in bowl.","FOR THE TURKEY: Place turkey breast side down on cutting board with cavity facing counter edge. Using kitchen shears, cut through bones on either side of backbone, staying as close as possible to backbone. Discard backbone. Flip turkey and press down firmly on breast with heels of your hands to flatten breastbone.","Sprinkle rub all over both sides of turkey. Open bottom vent of charcoal grill completely. To make charcoal snake, arrange 50 charcoal briquettes, 2 briquettes wide, around perimeter of grill, overlapping slightly so briquettes are touching and leaving 9-inch gap between ends of snake. Place second layer of 50 briquettes, also 2 briquettes wide, on top of first. (Completed arrangement should be 2 briquettes wide by 2 briquettes high.)","Starting 2 inches from each end of charcoal snake, place wood chunks on top of charcoal about 2 inches apart. Slide disposable pan into charcoal gap, running lengthwise into arc of snake and touching grill wall on opposite side of snake. Pour 6 cups water into pan.","Light chimney starter filled with 20 briquettes (pile briquettes on 1 side of chimney so they catch). When coals are partially covered with ash, use tongs to pile 10 coals on each end of charcoal snake, where briquettes meet water pan, so both ends of snake ignite.","Set cooking grate in place, then clean and oil grate. Position turkey, skin side down, over water pan, with drumsticks pointing toward arc in charcoal snake. Cover grill, position lid vent over turkey, and open lid vent completely. Cook, undisturbed, for 2 hours.","Using small barbecue mop or basting brush, baste turkey liberally with mop. Using oven mitts or grill mitts, flip turkey skin side up, again positioning it over water pan with drumsticks pointing toward arc in charcoal snake. Baste skin side liberally with more mop (you may not need all of it; discard any extra).","Insert temperature probe into thickest part of breast. Cover grill and cook until breast registers 160 degrees (check temperature of both sides of breast) and thighs register 175 degrees, about 1 hour.","Transfer turkey to rimmed baking sheet. Let rest for 30 to 40 minutes. Carve turkey and transfer to serving platter. Serve."]

notes: "This recipe is adapted from Rodney Scotts holiday turkey recipe in his cookbook, Rodney Scotts World of BBQ (2021). We developed this recipe using a 22-inch kettle charcoal grill. We recommend reading the entire recipe before starting. You can reserve the turkey neck and giblets for making gravy, if desired."
