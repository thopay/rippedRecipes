notes: "It’s important to follow visual cues when making the eggs, as your pan’s thickness will affect the cooking time. If you’re using an electric stovetop for the eggs, heat a second burner on low and move the skillet to it when it’s time to adjust the heat. You can substitute store-bought tortillas for the homemade. This recipe makes enough filling for 12 (6-inch) tacos."
