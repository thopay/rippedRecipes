Repeat with fresh water, as needed, until grit no longer appears in bottom of bowl. Drain collards in colander, but do not dry.","Add damp collards, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to Dutch oven. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until tender, 14 to 17 minutes, stirring occasionally. (If pot becomes dry, add 1/4 cup water so collards continue to steam.) Drain collards in colander, pressing with rubber spatula to release excess liquid. Wipe out Dutch oven with paper towels.","Heat 1/4 cup oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add raisins, shallots, garlic, and pepper flakes and cook until just beginning to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Add collards, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Transfer collards to platter. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with almonds. Serve with lemon wedges and extra Parmesan."]
