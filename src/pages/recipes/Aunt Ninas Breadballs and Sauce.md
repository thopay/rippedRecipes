instructions: ["ASSEMBLE BREADBALLS Combine water, egg, garlic, parsley, basil, and pepper in large bowl. Add bread and Parmesan and mix with hands until well combined. Using wet hands, form mixture into 1 1/2-inch breadballs (you should have about 30).","BROWN BREADBALLS Heat 1/4 cup oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook half of breadballs without moving until well browned on bottom, 2 to 4 minutes. Continue to cook, turning gently, until well browned all over, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl. Repeat with remaining oil and breadballs.","MAKE SAUCE Pour off all but 1 tablespoon oil from pot. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, sugar, garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook until tomato paste begins to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Add water, tomatoes, and tomato sauce and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.","SIMMER AND SERVE Carefully add browned breadballs to pot and continue to simmer, covered, until sauce is slightly thickened and breadballs are tender, about 30 minutes. Off heat, stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve, sprinkling with Parmesan (and additional parsley, if desired)."]

notes: "Let breadballs form a good crust during frying or they will fall apart when simmered. To keep them from sticking to the pan, make sure the oil is shimmering before you start cooking and dont move them for the first few minutes of browning."
