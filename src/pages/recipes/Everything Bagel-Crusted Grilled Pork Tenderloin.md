Scrape and oil cooking grate.","COAT PORK Meanwhile, pat pork dry with paper towels. Combine sesame seeds, garlic, peppercorns, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, salt, and cornmeal on rimmed baking sheet. Place cornstarch in large bowl. Beat egg whites in second large bowl until foamy. One at a time, coat tenderloins lightly with cornstarch, dip in egg whites, and transfer to rimmed baking sheet to coat with spice mixture.","GRILL PORK Spray tenderloins lightly with cooking spray and grill, covered, over hot side of grill, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 6 to 8 minutes. Slide pork to cooler side of grill and continue to cook, covered, until meat registers 145 degrees, 6 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer pork to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes.
