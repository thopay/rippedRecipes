notes: "Freshness is key when serving fish raw. The flesh of raw tuna should appear moist and shiny; feel firm to the touch (the flesh should spring right back when pressed); and smell clean, not fishy. Notify your fishmonger that you plan to serve the fish raw and inquire about its freshness. Try to have the fishmonger slice tuna steaks to order that have little to no connective tissue, since it can be unpleasantly chewy when eaten raw. Vidalia, Maui, or Walla Walla sweet onions will all work here. If you can’t find sweet onions, you can substitute a yellow onion by soaking the thinly sliced onion in ice water for 20 minutes and then draining and patting it dry. Serve this poke as a snack or an appetizer, or make it a meal by serving it over warm rice. Furikake is a Japanese seasoning blend that comes in many styles. We recommend using a blend containing dried seaweed (nori and/or kombu), bonito flakes, and sesame seeds. Look for it at an Asian market, in the Asian section of the grocery store, or online.&nbsp;"
