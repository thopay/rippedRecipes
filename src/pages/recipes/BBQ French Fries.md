Fry half of potatoes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Replace paper towels on baking sheet and drain fries. Return oil to 375 degrees and add remaining fries. When second batch is golden brown, return first batch to oil and fry until all fries are deep golden brown and crisp, 1 to 3 minutes.
