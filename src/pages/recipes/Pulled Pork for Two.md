Brown pork in 2 batches, 3 to 4 minutes per side, and transfer to second plate.","BRAISE PORK Add onion to pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ketchup, vinegar, and remaining brown sugar, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Return bacon and browned pork and any accumulated juices to pot. Transfer to oven and braise, covered, until pork is fork-tender, about 1½ hours.","SHRED PORK Transfer pork to bowl and, using 2 forks, shred into bite-size pieces.
