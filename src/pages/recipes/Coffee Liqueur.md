notes: "For a more intensely flavored liqueur, you can substitute dark-roast coffee beans for the medium-roast; we do not recommend using light-roast beans. You can substitute 1½ teaspoons cocoa powder for the cacao nibs, but the resulting liqueur will be slightly cloudy. You will need a pint-size glass jar with a tight-fitting lid for this recipe. This recipe can be doubled."
