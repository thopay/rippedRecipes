instructions: ["FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bottom, sides, and center of 10-cup tube pan, then dust pan with cornmeal, tapping out excess.","Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and cornmeal together in bowl. Whisk 1½ cups sugar, buttermilk, melted butter, eggs, vanilla, and almond extract in separate bowl until fully combined. Whisk flour mixture into sugar mixture until just combined. Transfer batter to prepared pan, smoothing into even layer with rubber spatula, and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.","Bake until top is browned and paring knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 30 minutes. Run paring knife around edges and center of pan. Invert cake onto parchment paper–lined baking sheet (cake will be sugared side down). Remove pan, place wire rack on top of cake, and reinvert cake sugared side up. Let cake cool completely, about 2 hours.","FOR THE FROSTING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add sugar, vanilla, and salt and mix on low speed until sugar is moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and smooth, about 3 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until slightly firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.","FOR THE TOPPING: Spread frosting evenly over top of cake. Pile strawberries evenly over top of frosting. Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with pistachios. Serve."]
