Add green chiles and pulse until combined, about 3 pulses.","Lay 18 by 11-inch sheet of plastic wrap on counter with long side parallel to counter edge.

notes: "We chill the cheese log in the freezer because it’s much easier to roll in the tortilla chips when firm. Once the cheese log has been garnished, it can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to two days."
