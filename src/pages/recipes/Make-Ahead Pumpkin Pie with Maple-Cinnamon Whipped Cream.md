time: "45 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling"
instructions: ["FOR THE PIE: Whisk cream and gelatin in microwave-safe bowl until all gelatin looks wet (mixture will be slightly lumpy). Let mixture sit until it looks like loose cottage cheese, about 5 minutes.","Microwave gelatin mixture until gelatin has melted, about 1 minute, whisking halfway through microwaving. Whisk until smooth and syrupy and no lumps remain. (If lumps persist, microwave in 10-second intervals, whisking after each, until smooth.)","Whisk pumpkin, sugar, maple syrup, ginger, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in large microwave-safe bowl until combined. Microwave pumpkin mixture until heated to 110 degrees, about 2 minutes, stirring halfway through microwaving. Immediately add gelatin mixture to pumpkin mixture and whisk to thoroughly combine.","Pour filling into crust. Gently shake pie so filling spreads to edges of crust; let cool for 10 minutes. Spray sheet of plastic wrap with vegetable oil spray and gently press onto filling. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.","FOR THE TOPPING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip all ingredients on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. (Topping can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Spread topping evenly over pie. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 4, pie can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil, and frozen for up to 2 weeks. To serve, completely unwrap pie and let thaw at room temperature for 5 hours. Make topping while pie thaws and spread over pie just before serving."]
