notes: "Use your favorite pie dough or our Single-Crust Pie Dough (see related recipe). Regular yellow cornmeal (not stone ground) works best here. Make the filling before baking the shell so the cornmeal has time to soften. Adding the filling when the pie shell is still warm reduces the pie’s cooking time slightly."
