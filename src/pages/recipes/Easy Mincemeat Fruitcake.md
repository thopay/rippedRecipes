Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 1 1/4 hours to 1 hour 25 minutes, switching and rotating pans halfway through baking. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 15 minutes. Invert cakes onto rack and let cool completely.","Brush tops and sides of cakes with extra brandy.

notes: "Mincemeat can be found in the baking section of most supermarkets. This recipe was tested using one 29-ounce jar of Robertson’s Mincemeat Classic. The test kitchen’s preferred loaf pan, the Williams-Sonoma Goldtouch Nonstick Loaf Pan, measures 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inches; if you use 9 by 5-inch loaf pans, start checking for doneness 5 minutes earlier than advised in the recipe. Shred the apple on the large holes of a box grater."
