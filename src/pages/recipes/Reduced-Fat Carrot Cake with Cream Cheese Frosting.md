With electric mixer on medium speed, beat eggs, baby food, and sugar until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add flour mixture in two additions, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary, and mix until batter is nearly smooth. Fold in carrots.","BAKE CAKE Spread batter in prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 24 to 28 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Cool cake in pan 10 minutes, then invert onto wire rack. Remove parchment and flip cake right-side up to cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.","MAKE FROSTING With mixer on medium-high speed, beat together cream cheese, marshmallow creme, and vanilla.

notes: "Any cream cheese with 1/3 less fat will work here. To ensure thick frosting, use marshmallow creme (such as Fluff or Jet-Puffed), not marshmallow sauce. Shred carrots on large holes of a box grater or with the shredding disk of a food processor."
