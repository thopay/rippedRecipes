instructions: ["Make watermelon ice: Scoop out and measure 5 cups watermelon pulp. Puree watermelon and sugar in batches in blender until smooth. Push puree through mesh strainer into medium bowl. Cover and freeze until puree is slightly slushy but not yet solid, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from freezer and stir well, scraping any slush from sides of bowl. Stir in chocolate chips.","Freeze pops: Place twelve 3-ounce disposable cups in shallow baking pan. Spoon watermelon puree into cups (puree will come to within 1/2 inch of rims). Place pan in freezer until puree is solid but not rock hard, 1 to 2 hours.","Add “rind”: Spread softened sherbet on top of each portion of watermelon puree so that it comes up to edge of cup; smooth sherbet with back of spoon. Cover each cup with plastic wrap and cut small slit in center of plastic. Insert Popsicle stick into pop so that it almost reaches bottom of cup. Freeze until solid, at least 5 hours and up to 2 days.","Unmold: Let pops sit at room temperature for 1 minute, then gently pull out from cups. (Alternatively, paper cups can be peeled away from pops.) Serve."]
