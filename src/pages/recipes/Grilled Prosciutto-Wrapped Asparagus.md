serves: 4
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Working with 2 asparagus spears at a time, tightly wrap 1 slice prosciutto around middle of spears to create bundle. (If prosciutto rips, slightly overlap ripped pieces and press with your fingers to stick it back together.) Brush bundles on both sides with oil and season with pepper.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Grill asparagus bundles (covered if using gas) until prosciutto is spotty brown and paring knife slips easily in and out of asparagus, 6 to 8 minutes, flipping bundles halfway through cooking. Transfer asparagus bundles to platter. Serve warm or at room temperature with lemon wedges."]

notes: "For the best results, look for spears that are bright green in color and firm to the touch, with tightly closed tips. If you are using asparagus spears that are thicker than ½ inch in diameter, you may have to increase the grilling time. Do not use asparagus that is thinner than ½ inch in diameter. This recipe can easily be doubled."
