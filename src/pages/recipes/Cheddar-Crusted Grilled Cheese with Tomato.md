ingredients: ["2 teaspoons, mayonnaise","4 slices, hearty white sandwich bread","2 slices, deli American cheese (1½ ounces)","4 thin, tomato slices","1 tablespoon, grated Parmesan cheese","Pinch , table salt","Pinch , pepper","Pinch , red pepper flakes","Pinch , dried oregano","Pinch , granulated garlic","4 ounces white sharp, cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup), divided","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter, divided"]
serves: 2
time: "35 minutes"
instructions: ["Spread mayonnaise evenly on 1 side of each slice of bread. Layer 1 slice of American cheese and 2 tomato slices on mayonnaise side of each of 2 slices of bread. Sprinkle tomato slices with Parmesan, salt, pepper, pepper flakes, oregano, and granulated garlic. Sprinkle ¼ cup cheddar over tomato slices on each sandwich, then top with remaining 2 slices of bread, mayonnaise side down.","Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place sandwiches in skillet. Cover and cook until deep golden brown on bottom, 4 to 7 minutes.","Using spatula, carefully flip sandwiches. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to center of skillet between sandwiches and tilt to distribute butter as it melts. Cover and continue to cook until second side is deep golden brown and cheese is visibly melted around edges of sandwiches, 2 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer sandwiches to wire rack.","Remove skillet from heat and wipe clean with paper towels. Sprinkle two ¼-cup portions of remaining cheddar into rectangles just larger than slices of bread, about 6 by 4 inches, on opposite sides of now-empty skillet. Place sandwiches directly on top of cheddar.","Return skillet to medium heat and cook until edges of cheddar beneath sandwiches are well browned and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes. (Do not slide spatula under sandwiches before cheddar is crisp; it will pull cheddar and ruin crust.) When cheddar is browned along edges, slide spatula underneath sandwiches and transfer, cheddar crust side up, to rack. (For decorative purposes, you can upturn edges of cheddar crust, if desired.)","Let sandwiches sit for 5 minutes to allow cheese to set. Transfer sandwiches to cutting board and cut diagonally. Serve."]

notes: "Its important to use a good nonstick skillet here. While crisping the cheese crust in step 5, avoid flipping the sandwiches too early. At first the cheese will be soft and melty, but it will crisp as it continues to cook. When sprinkling the cheese in the skillet for the crust, be sure to leave enough room between the portions so that the cheese doesnt run together. For the best flavor, buy the American cheese from the deli counter, not the presliced cheese that comes wrapped in cellophane."
