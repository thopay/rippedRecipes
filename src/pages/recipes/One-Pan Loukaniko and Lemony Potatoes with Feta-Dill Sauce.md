notes: "Loukaniko (Greek pork sausage) is usually available at specialty Greek markets and online (it may be spelled “locanico” or “loucanico”). If you cant find it, kielbasa, linguica, and andouille are good substitutes; if the sausages are longer than 6 inches, cut them crosswise into smaller lengths."
