notes: "There are about 35 saltines in one sleeve of crackers. Be sure to use small red potatoes measuring 1 to 2 inches in diameter here. Look for Brussels sprouts with small, tight heads that are no more than 1½ inches in diameter, as they’re likely to be sweeter and more tender than larger sprouts."
