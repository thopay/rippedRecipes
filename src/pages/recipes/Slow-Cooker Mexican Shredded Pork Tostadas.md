notes: "Mexican tinga is traditionally served on tostadas (crisp fried corn tortillas), but it is also served in tacos or burritos or over rice. You can use store-bought tostada shells or make your own (recipe follows). Our favorite ready-made tostadas are Mission Tostadas Estilo Casero. Two teaspoons of minced canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce can be substituted for the chipotle chile powder, if desired."
