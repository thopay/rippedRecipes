Cover tartar sauce and refrigerate until ready to serve.","Spread panko in shallow dish. Pulse one-third of shrimp, Old Bay, salt, remaining 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, and remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper in food processor until shrimp are finely chopped, about 4 pulses. Add remaining two-thirds of shrimp to mixture in processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, about 6 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer shrimp mixture to bowl and stir in scallion greens.","Divide shrimp mixture into 4 equal portions (about ⅓ cup each) and shape into 3½-inch-diameter patties. Working with 1 patty at a time, dredge both sides in panko, pressing lightly to adhere, and transfer to plate.","Line plate with triple layer of paper towels. Heat oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place patties in skillet and cook until golden brown on first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip patties and continue to cook until patties register 140 to 145 degrees and second side is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer patties to prepared plate and let drain, about 30 seconds per side.","Spread tartar sauce on bun bottoms and cocktail sauce on bun tops. Place patties on bun bottoms. Top with lettuce and cover with bun tops. Serve."]

notes: "We prefer untreated shrimp—those not treated with sodium or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP). Most frozen shrimp have been treated (the ingredient list should tell you). If youre using treated shrimp, decrease the amount of salt to ⅛ teaspoon. If youre purchasing shell-on shrimp, you should buy about 1 pound. We recommend using Martins Dinner Potato Rolls here."
