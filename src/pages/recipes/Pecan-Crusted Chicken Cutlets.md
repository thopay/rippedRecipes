Thoroughly coat chicken with nut mixture, pressing on coating to help it adhere, and transfer to large plate.","Heat 1/2 cup oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place 4 cutlets in skillet and cook until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side (lower heat if crust is browning too quickly).
