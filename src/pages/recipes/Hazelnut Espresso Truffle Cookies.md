serves: 24
time: "2 hours, plus 1½ hours chilling"
instructions: ["Whisk flour, hazelnuts, salt, and baking powder together in medium bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and yolk, one at a time, espresso powder, and vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions until just combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Divide dough in half. Form each half into 5-inch disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Let chilled dough soften on counter for 10 minutes. Roll 1 disk of dough into 14-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick, on lightly floured counter. Using 2¼-inch cookie cutter, cut out 30 rounds, rerolling scraps just once. Space cookies ½ inch apart on prepared sheets. Bake until edges are slightly browned, about 7 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Repeat with second disk of dough and cooled sheets. Let cookies cool completely before frosting.","Heat cream in small saucepan over medium heat until simmering. Place 1 3/4 cups chocolate chips in medium bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate chips; cover with aluminum foil and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk chocolate mixture until smooth. Refrigerate chocolate ganache, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 40 minutes.","Using small metal spatula, spread 2 teaspoons ganache on bottoms of each of 30 cookies. Top with remaining cookies to form sandwiches. Microwave remaining 1¼ cups chocolate chips in bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2 to 4 minutes. Drizzle chocolate over cookies and let set, about 30 minutes, before serving. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]

notes: "Both the dough and the filling need to chill. If you don’t have superfine sugar, you can use granulated sugar processed for 30 seconds in a food processor. Use a thin spatula to help move these thin cookies from the counter to the baking sheets. To quickly cool the baking sheets between batches, run them under cold water."
