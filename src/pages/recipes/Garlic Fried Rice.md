notes: "One-and-a-half cups of raw jasmine rice cooked with 2¼ cups of water will yield 4½ cups of cooked rice. Make sure that the rice is cold before frying; otherwise, it can turn gummy. We run the cooled rice under water to break up the clumps so that its easier to manage in the skillet. Be sure to let the excess water drain off the rice for at least 5 minutes before transferring it to the skillet."
