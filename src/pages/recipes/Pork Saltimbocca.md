serves: 4
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Cut each tenderloin crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, place pork, cut side down, between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using meat pounder, gently pound to even 1/4-inch thickness. (Pieces should be about 5 inches long.) Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with pepper.","Place 1 prosciutto slice on top of each cutlet, folding as needed to prevent overhang. Dip 1 side of each sage leaf in egg white and place 1 leaf, egg side down, in center of each prosciutto slice. Cover with plastic and pound lightly until prosciutto and sage adhere to pork.","Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of pork to skillet, prosciutto side down, and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully flip pork and cook until second side is light golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to platter and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining pork.","Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and minced sage and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and wine and simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, 5 to 7 minutes, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time. Stir in lemon juice and any accumulated meat juices from platter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over pork and serve."]
