notes: "If Meyer lemons are unavailable, you can get a similar flavor by combining the juices from lemons and a mandarin or navel orange. Substitute 3 tablespoons lemon zest and 1 tablespoon mandarin or navel orange zest and ⅓ cup juice from each. We like to use this curd in our Thumbprint Cookies."
