ingredients: ["10 ounces sheep's-milk, feta cheese in brine, drained and shredded (2 cups)","2 ounces graviera, cheese, shredded (⅔ cup)","4 ounces (½ cup) whole-milk, cottage cheese","2 , large eggs, lightly beaten","2 teaspoons, cornstarch","½ teaspoon, dried mint (optional)","16 (14 by 9-inch), phyllo sheets, thawed","12 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted"]
serves: 12
time: "1¾ hours"
instructions: ["FOR THE FILLING: Combine all ingredients (including dried mint, if using) in bowl. Set aside.","FOR THE PHYLLO: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.","Lay 1 phyllo sheet on clean counter with short side parallel to edge of counter. Brush lightly with melted butter. Place second phyllo sheet directly over first sheet and brush lightly with melted butter. Cut sheets lengthwise into thirds to make 3 long strips, each about 2¾ inches wide.","Place heaping tablespoon of filling on bottom center of each strip. Working with 1 strip at a time, fold up left corner of phyllo strip to center of strip, right above filling. Fold in right corner to left edge to create triangle at bottom of strip. Fold triangle over itself. Continue folding up and over (as if folding a flag) to end of strip. Gently press filling to distribute evenly (it will not go all the way to corners; this is OK).","Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling to make 24 triangles. Place seam side down on prepared sheets, 12 triangles per sheet. Brush triangles with melted butter. Bake triangles until evenly golden, 16 to 20 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool for 10 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "Phyllo dough is also available in larger 18 by 14-inch sheets; if using, cut them in half to make 9 by 14-inch sheets. Dont use thicker, “country-style” phyllo here. Do not thaw the phyllo in the microwave; let it sit in the refrigerator overnight or on the counter for 4 to 5 hours. While working with the phyllo, cover it with plastic wrap and then a damp dish towel to prevent drying. Shred the feta on the large holes of a box grater. You can substitute Gruyere for the graviera, if desired. Use enough butter to cover the phyllo well; its OK if you dont use all of it."
