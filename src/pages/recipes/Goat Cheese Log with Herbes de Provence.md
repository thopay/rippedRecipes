instructions: ["Process goat cheese, cream cheese, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, and pepper in food processor until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 1 minute.","Lay 18 by 11-inch sheet of plastic wrap on counter with long side parallel to counter edge. Transfer cheese mixture to center of plastic and shape into approximate 9-inch log with long side parallel to counter edge. Fold plastic over log and roll up.

notes: "We chill the cheese log in the freezer because it’s much easier to roll in the herbes de Provence when firm. Once the cheese log has been garnished, it can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to two days."
