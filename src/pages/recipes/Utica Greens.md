notes: "Youll need two large heads of escarole. You can use either hot or sweet capicola. Whichever you choose, buy a 1/2-inch-thick slice (or use prosciutto) at the deli counter; avoid the prepackaged thin slices, since youll want hearty cubes of meat for this dish. Do not use canned bread crumbs here."
