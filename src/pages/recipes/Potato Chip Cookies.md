notes: "Cape Cod 40% Reduced Fat Potato Chips is the test kitchen favorite among reduced-fat chips. In this recipe, they make for extremely crunchy cookies. To prevent sticking, dip the drinking glass in flour before flattening each cookie. Toast the pecans in a small, dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the skillet often, until they begin to darken, three to five minutes.&nbsp;"
