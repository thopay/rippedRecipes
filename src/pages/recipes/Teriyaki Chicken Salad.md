notes: "Three split breasts from our Grilled Chicken Teriyaki (see related recipe) will yield the 3 cups of shredded meat needed for this recipe. Youll also need 3 tablespoons of the teriyaki glaze. If you dont have enough chicken, you can use shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken. A Microplane grater makes quick work of grating ginger."
