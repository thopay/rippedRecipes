notes: "Cod is our favorite fish in this stew, but halibut and swordfish are also good choices. Use only the white and light green parts of the leeks. Slice leeks in half lengthwise, wash well, and then cut crosswise into thin slices. If you can’t find chorizo, use hot Italian sausage. Serve this stew with thick slices of crusty bread."
