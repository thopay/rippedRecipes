Cool until glaze hardens, at least 20 minutes.","For the filling: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine all ingredients except butter in bowl. Using fork, stir in butter until mixture resembles wet sand.","For the dough: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk and butter in small bowl. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until combined. Knead dough on lightly floured work surface until smooth, about 5 minutes.","Roll dough into 12 by 9-inch rectangle. Pat filling into dough, leaving 1/2-inch border around edges. Starting at one long end, roll dough into tight cylinder and pinch seam together. Cut log into 8 pieces and arrange cut side down on cooled glaze, placing 1 roll in center and remaining rolls around edge of pan.","Bake until rolls are golden and glaze is darkened and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then turn out onto platter. Let rolls sit 10 minutes before serving."]
