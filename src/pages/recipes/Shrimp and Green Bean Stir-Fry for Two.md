notes: "We prefer untreated shrimp—those without added sodium or preservatives such as sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP). Most frozen supermarket E-Z peel shrimp have been treated. To be sure, check the ingredient list. Shrimp should be the only ingredient listed on the package. If youre using treated shrimp, use low-sodium soy sauce. Lee Kum Kee makes our favorite oyster sauce. Serve with rice."
