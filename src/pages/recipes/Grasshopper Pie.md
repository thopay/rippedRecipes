description: "Today grasshopper pie means ice cream. But it started off as a mint and chocolate chiffon dessert based on a Prohibition-era cocktail. We went retro and brought back the original."

ingredients: ["16 , Oreo Mint n' Creme cookies (with filling), broken into rough pieces","3 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted and cooled","3 , large egg yolks","1 envelope, unflavored gelatin","1/2 cup (3½ ounces), sugar","2 cups, heavy cream","Pinch, table salt","1/4 cup, green creme de menthe","1/4 cup, white creme de cacao"]
serves: 8
time: "55 minutes, plus 6¾ hours chilling"
instructions: ["For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grind cookies in food processor to fine crumbs. Transfer to bowl, drizzle with melted butter, and toss well. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press crumbs evenly into bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie plate and refrigerate crust until firm, about 20 minutes. Bake until set, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely on wire rack.","For the filling: Beat egg yolks in medium bowl. Combine gelatin, sugar, 1/2 cup cream, and salt in medium saucepan and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Cook over medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture is very hot but not boiling, about 2 minutes. Whisking vigorously, slowly add gelatin mixture to egg yolks. Return mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add creme de menthe and creme de cacao. Pour into clean bowl and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until wobbly but not set, about 20 minutes.","Beat remaining 1 1/2 cups cream with electric mixer to stiff peaks. Whisk 1 cup whipped cream into gelatin mixture until completely incorporated. Using rubber spatula, fold gelatin mixture into remaining whipped cream until no streaks of white remain. Scrape mixture into cooled pie shell, smooth top, and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight. (The pie will keep tightly wrapped in refrigerator for up to 2 days.) Serve, topped with chocolate curls, if desired."]
