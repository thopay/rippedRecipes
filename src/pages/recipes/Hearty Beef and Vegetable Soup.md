description: "Homemade beef stock is a guaranteed method for producing great beef and vegetable soup, but most of us buy a can and then try to doctor it up. Many of these quick fixes are ultimately unsatisfying. But the right cut of meat turns canned broth into a satisfying bowl of soup."

instructions: ["For the broth: Season blade steaks with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of steaks and cook until well browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. Set steaks aside on plate. Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil and steaks.","Pour off fat from Dutch oven and return to medium-high heat. Add tomato paste and cook, mashing paste with wooden spoon, for 30 seconds. Add chicken broth, beef broth, and water, and scrape browned bits from bottom of pot with wooden spoon. Return steaks and any accumulated juices to pot. Add garlic, bay leaves, and thyme and bring to simmer, using wide, shallow spoon to skim off foam or fat that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently (do not boil) until meat is tender, about 2 hours.","Transfer steaks and garlic head to rimmed plate to cool. Once cool enough to handle, shred meat into bite-sized pieces, discarding any fat. Using tongs, squeeze garlic cloves into small bowl. Mash with fork until paste forms. Pour broth through fine-mesh strainer. Return shredded beef and garlic paste to broth. (Broth can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 2 months.)","For the soup: Melt butter in clean Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and carrots and cook until onion is softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and broth. Bring to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.","To serve, adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and sprinkle with parsley."]
