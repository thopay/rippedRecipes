notes: "The skillet may look very full when you add the broccoli to it in step 2, but the pieces of broccoli will shrink as they cook. In step 3, the broccoli pieces will begin to look very dark; this is OK. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute), and then remove the skillet from the heat so the seeds wont scorch."
