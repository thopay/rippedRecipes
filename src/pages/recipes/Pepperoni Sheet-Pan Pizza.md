serves: 6
time: "1¼ hours, plus 1 hour 20 minutes rising"
instructions: ["FOR THE DOUGH: Whisk flour, yeast, and sugar together in bowl of stand mixer. Fit mixer with dough hook. Mix flour mixture on low speed while slowly adding water until dough forms and no dry flour remains, 2 to 4 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes.","Add salt and mix on medium speed until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 6 to 8 minutes. Lightly spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Rub bottom and sides of pan with olive oil. Using dough scraper or your greased hands, transfer dough to oiled sheet and turn to coat. With your greased hands, stretch dough into rough 12 by 8-inch rectangle of even thickness. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place until puffed and nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour.","Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place pizza steel on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.","FOR THE SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in bowl. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Using your greased hands, gently stretch dough to corners of sheet, pressing lightly with your fingertips to deflate dough and carefully lifting corners and edges of dough to pull toward edges of sheet. (It's OK if dough shrinks back slightly from corners of sheet at this point.) Cover loosely with plastic and let rise in warm place until slightly puffed, about 20 minutes.","Using your greased hands, press dough all the way to edges and corners of sheet. Using your fingertips, pinch edges of dough against sides of sheet to form small lip.","FOR THE PIZZA: Using bottom of ½-cup dry measuring cup or large spoon, spread sauce into thin layer over surface of dough, leaving ½-inch border. Sprinkle Parmesan evenly over sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella over entire surface of dough, making sure some cheese sits on edges of dough against sheet. Top pizza with pepperoni.","Bake until cheese is bubbly and well browned, about 15 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Run knife around edge of sheet to loosen pizza and transfer pizza to wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes. Slice and serve, sprinkled with extra Parmesan and pepper flakes as desired."]

notes: "If you dont own a pizza steel, you can use a pizza stone or an overturned heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet. We developed this recipe using our winning rimmed baking sheet, the Nordic Ware Bakers Half Sheet. We prefer to buy link pepperoni and slice it thin rather than using presliced pepperoni. Avoid preshredded cheese; it contains added starch, which gives the melted cheese a drier, chewier texture."
