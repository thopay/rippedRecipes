instructions: ["Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are al dente and paring knife inserted into them meets some resistance, about 3 minutes. Drain potatoes in colander and transfer to bowl; set aside.","Combine 2 cups onion; chunjang; sugar; oyster sauce; and monosodium glutamate, if using, in second bowl and set aside. Stir 1 cup water and cornstarch together in liquid measuring cup; set aside.","Cook pork in 14-inch wok or large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.","Add scallions and oil to pork mixture and cook for 1 minute. Stir in chunjang mixture and cook until onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Add cabbage, potatoes, and remaining 2 cups onion and cook until cabbage is softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in shrimp and cook for 30 seconds.","Stir cornstarch mixture to recombine, then stir into sauce. Bring to boil and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened and glossy, about 3 minutes; remove from heat. (Jajang sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)","Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add noodles and cook, stirring often, until tender. Drain noodles and rinse under hot running water, tossing gently, for 1 minute. Drain noodles again and transfer to serving bowls. Spoon jajang sauce over noodles. Serve with cucumber and danmuji, if using."]

notes: "We prefer to use roasted chunjang for its more complex flavor; you can substitute an unroasted version if thats all you can find. Monosodium glutamate is optional but provides the sauce with deep seasoning. Fresh (or fresh-frozen) Korean udon noodles are often sold in 1-kilogram (35-ounce) packages and contain individual bundles of noodles weighing 8 to 9 ounces each; these are thinner and less chewy than Japanese udon. You can use any size shrimp here."
