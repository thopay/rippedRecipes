instructions: ["CHILL STEAKS Combine salt and cornstarch in small bowl. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and rub with salt mixture. Place steaks on wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet and freeze until steaks are firm and dry to the touch, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.","HEAT GRILL Heat all burners on high, covered, for 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn other burner(s) off. (For charcoal grill, light about 100 coals; when they are covered with fine gray ash, spread over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place and heat, covered, with lid vent open completely, for 5 minutes.) Scrape and oil cooking grate.","GRILL STEAKS Season steaks with pepper. Grill, covered, over hot fire, turning once, until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Move steaks to cool side of grill and continue to cook to desired doneness, 5 to 6 minutes for rare (120 degrees on instant-read thermometer), 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare (125 degrees), or 8 to 9 minutes for medium (135 degrees). Transfer to plate, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "To achieve a great crust, steaks must be dry, a characteristic that steakhouses get by aging their meat. To mimic the effect, we rub the steaks with cornstarch (which absorbs moisture) and salt (for flavor). We also rely on the freezer: Just 30 minutes uncovered in the freezer’s intensely dry environment sufficiently dehydrates the exteriors of steaks."
