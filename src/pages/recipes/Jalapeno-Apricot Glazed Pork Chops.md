notes: "We prefer natural pork here, but if your pork is enhanced (injected with a salt solution), decrease the salt in step 1 to ½ teaspoon per chop. Use pork chops of the same thickness to ensure even cooking. Pork chops can buckle during cooking and cook unevenly. To prevent this, we use kitchen shears to snip the fat surrounding the loin portion of each chop."
