Run knife around edge of skillet to loosen cake. Place large, flat serving platter over skillet. Using potholders and holding platter tightly, invert skillet and platter together; lift off skillet (if any peaches stick to skillet, remove and position on top of cake).

notes: "If using frozen peaches, be sure to thaw and drain them before using; otherwise, they will produce a mushy cake. We like to serve this cake with whipped cream."
