serves: 14
time: "20 minutes, plus 1½ to 2 hours freezing and 1 hour tempering"
instructions: ["Process blue cheese, cream cheese, and pepper in food processor until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 1 minute.","Lay 18 by 11-inch sheet of plastic wrap on counter with long side parallel to counter edge. Transfer cheese mixture to center of plastic and shape into approximate 9-inch log with long side parallel to counter edge. Fold plastic over log and roll up. Pinch plastic at ends of log and roll log on counter to form tight cylinder. Tuck ends of plastic underneath. Freeze until completely firm, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.","Combine walnuts and dates on large plate and spread into even layer. Unwrap cheese log and roll in walnut-date mixture to evenly coat. Transfer to serving dish and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Drizzle with honey and serve."]

notes: "We chill the cheese log in the freezer because it’s much easier to roll in the walnut-date mixture when firm. Once the cheese log has been garnished, it can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to two days."
