serves: 10
time: "1½ hours, plus 2 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Spray or lightly sprinkle 2 approximately 16 by 12-inch pieces of parchment paper evenly with cold water. Crumple each piece of parchment into ball, then gently uncrumple. Overlap parchment pieces slightly to form approximately 16-inch square. Press parchment into bottom and sides of 9-inch springform pan. Fold overhanging parchment outward, over edge of pan. Using scissors or kitchen shears, trim overhanging parchment to about 1 inch past edge of pan.","Process eggs and sugar in large (14-cup) food processor until mixture is frothy and pale yellow, about 1 minute. Add cream cheese, heavy cream, and flour and pulse until cream cheese is broken into large, even pieces, 8 to 10 pulses. Process until mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl and breaking up any large clumps of cream cheese as needed (processor bowl will be very full).","Transfer batter to prepared pan and place pan on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until top of cheesecake is deeply browned, edges are set, and center of cheesecake registers 155 degrees, 45 to 55 minutes (center will be very jiggly). Remove cheesecake from oven and transfer to wire rack. Let cheesecake cool in pan for at least 2 hours.","Remove side of pan. Gently peel parchment away from sides of cheesecake until parchment is flush with counter. To slice, dip sharp knife in very hot water and wipe dry after each cut. Serve slightly warm (after 2 hours cooling) or at room temperature. (Cheesecake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; let sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before serving.)"]

notes: "If you dont have a 14-cup food processor, you can use a large, deep bowl and an immersion blender. Do not use cream cheese spread, whipped or low-fat cream cheese, or neufchatel. To ensure that the cheesecake cooks properly within the given time frame, be sure all ingredients are at room temperature (65 to 70 degrees). Use an oven thermometer to be sure your oven is reading 425 degrees before baking. To avoid overcooking, we strongly recommend using a thermometer in step 3 to confirm when the center of the cheesecake reaches 155 degrees. Serve with Basque Cider Salted Caramel Sauce, if desired."
