notes: "We like to use vacuum-packed cooked beets, which are available in the produce section of many grocery stores. You can also use drained canned beets or leftover steamed or roasted beets, or you can cook your beets in the microwave: Peel and cut 1 pound of raw beets into ½-inch pieces, and microwave in a covered bowl with ¼ cup water until tender, about 25 minutes."
