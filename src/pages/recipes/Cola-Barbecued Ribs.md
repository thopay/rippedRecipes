description: "Cola ribs are becoming increasingly popular with backyard and even competition barbecuers. Unfortunately, the sugary cola can burn on the outside of the ribs and the cola flavor is often minimal. The secret to harnessing cola flavor is to tame the sodas sweetness and augment its base flavors with similar spices."

time: "5Â¼ hours"
instructions: ["For the spice rub and ribs: Combine sugar, paprika, pepper, salt, and five-spice powder, breaking up any lumps. Reserve 2 tablespoons for sauce. Dry ribs with paper towels and rub all over with remaining spice mixture. (Ribs can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for 24 hours.)","Seal wood chips in foil packet and cut vent holes in top. Open bottom vent on grill. Light 100 coals; when covered with fine gray ash, pour in pile on one side of grill. Arrange foil packet directly on coals. Set cooking grate in place and heat, covered, with lid vent open halfway, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 5 minutes. (For gas grill, place foil packet directly on primary burner. Heat all burners on high, covered, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and shut other burner[s] off.) Scrape and oil cooking grate. Arrange ribs on cool side of grill and barbecue, covered, flipping and rotating racks once, until ribs are deep red and smoky, about 2 hours.","For the sauce: While ribs are barbecuing, bring cola to boil in large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, process onion and water in food processor until finely ground. Transfer mixture to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl and press on solids to collect as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Whisk 1/4 cup onion juice, ketchup, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire, and reserved spice mixture into pot with reduced cola. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in vanilla.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Brush ribs liberally with sauce and wrap tightly with foil. Arrange foil-wrapped ribs on rimmed baking sheet and bake until ribs are completely tender, about 2 hours. Transfer ribs (still in foil) to cutting board and let rest 15 minutes. Unwrap ribs and serve, passing remaining sauce at table."]

notes: "Use a paring knife to loosen the membrane on the back of the ribs, grasp with a paper towel, and peel off in one piece. Chinese five-spice powder is available in the spice aisle of most supermarkets."
