serves: 6
time: "3 to 3½ hours"
instructions: ["FOR THE SAUCE: Whisk orange juice, sugar, vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce, cornstarch, and fish sauce together in bowl. Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add jalapenos, garlic, and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in orange juice mixture and bring to boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Transfer ½ cup sauce to bowl, leaving jalapenos behind, and set aside.","FOR THE RIBS: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Sprinkle ribs all over with salt and pepper. Place ribs on prepared wire rack and brush all over with reserved ½ cup sauce. Arrange ribs meat side up. Roast until tender (fork inserted into meat will meet no resistance) and middle of rib rack registers at least 205 degrees, 2 to 2½ hours.","Brush tops of ribs with ¼ cup remaining sauce. Return ribs to oven and roast until sauce sets, about 10 minutes. Let ribs cool for 5 minutes. Reheat remaining sauce over medium heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Cut ribs between bones. Toss ribs, half of scallions, and remaining sauce together in large bowl. Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with remaining scallions. Serve."]

notes: "For a slightly spicier sauce, we leave the seeds in the jalapenos when slicing them into rings. If you’re averse to spice, remove the seeds before slicing."
