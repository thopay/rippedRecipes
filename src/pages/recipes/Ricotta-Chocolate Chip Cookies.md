instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in bowl; set aside.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and yolk and vanilla and beat until combined, about 15 seconds. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with ricotta in 2 additions, scraping down bowl as needed. Stir in chocolate chips by hand.","Working with 1 heaping tablespoon dough at a time, drop dough evenly onto prepared sheets. Bake until cookies are set around edges, 12 to 14 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 5 days.)"]
