Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.","Transfer bread mixture to food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, about 5 pulses. Add red peppers, vinegar, honey, paprika, salt, cayenne, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil to processor. Pulse until finely chopped, 5 to 8 pulses. Transfer sauce to bowl and set aside for serving. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, starting at thick end, cut breasts in half horizontally. Using meat pounder, gently pound each cutlet between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to even ¼-inch thickness. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper.","Wipe now-empty skillet clean with paper towels. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place 4 cutlets in skillet and cook, without moving them, until browned on first side, about 2 minutes. Flip cutlets and continue to cook until opaque on second side, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer cutlets to serving platter and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining 4 cutlets and remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Serve with sauce."]
