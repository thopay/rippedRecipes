ingredients: ["¼ cup, mayonnaise","2 tablespoons, prepared horseradish","1 , garlic clove, minced","1 teaspoon, Dijon mustard","1 teaspoon, minced fresh thyme","½ teaspoon, pepper","1¼ pounds large, Yukon Gold potato, unpeeled","2 cups peanut or, vegetable oil for frying","1 (12- to 16-ounce), boneless strip steak, 1½ inches thick, trimmed","1 3/4 teaspoons, kosher salt, divided","1 teaspoon, pepper","1 tablespoon peanut or, vegetable oil"]
serves: 2
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["FOR THE HORSERADISH AIOLI: Combine all ingredients in bowl; set aside.","FOR THE STEAK AND FRITES: Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack with triple layer of paper towels.","Square off potatoes by cutting ⅛-inch-thick slice from each of their 4 long sides (save slices for another use). Cut potatoes lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick planks. Stack 3 or 4 planks and cut into ¼-inch-thick strips. Repeat with remaining planks; set aside.","Combine potatoes and 2 cups oil in large saucepan. Cook potatoes over high heat, without stirring them, until limp but exteriors are beginning to firm, 15 to 17 minutes. Using tongs, stir fries, gently scraping up any that stick to bottom, and continue to cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes longer.","Meanwhile, pat steak dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add steak and cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until well browned and meat registers 115 degrees (for medium-rare), 12 to 16 minutes (steak will continue to cook as it rests). Transfer steak to unlined side of wire rack, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.","Transfer fries to paper towel–lined side of wire rack and sprinkle with remaining ¾ teaspoon salt. Transfer steak to carving board and slice ¼ inch thick. Serve steak with fries and horseradish aioli."]

notes: "This recipe will also work with a boneless rib-eye steak of a similar thickness. We recommend reading the entire recipe before starting. Its important to cook the fries and steak simultaneously so that both components will be ready to eat at the same time."
