notes: "These cookies are inspired by Mallomars but taste much better. Freezing the Fluff-topped cookies before coating them with chocolate prevents the Fluff from losing its shape. We like Carrs biscuits in this recipe for their round shape, crisp texture, and gentle sweetness. You can substitute 1 1/3 cups bittersweet chocolate chips for the bittersweet chocolate."
