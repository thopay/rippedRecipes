notes: "Use the freshest strawberries you can find, and try to buy smaller strawberries for the best flavor. After hulling the strawberries, you should have 2 pounds of fruit. Weighing the prepped amount is important, as the ratio of fruit to sugar is crucial to the success of the recipe. If using a canister-style ice cream maker, be sure to freeze the empty canister for at least 24 hours and preferably two days before churning the sorbet. For self-refrigerating machines, prechill the canister by running the machine for 5 to 10 minutes before pouring in the sorbet mixture. The sorbet is best eaten within a week, but it can be frozen for up to a month."
