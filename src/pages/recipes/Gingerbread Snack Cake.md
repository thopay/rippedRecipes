notes: "If you cant find sorghum syrup, you can substitute molasses—just make sure its not blackstrap. We like the complexity of a bitter orange marmalade—such as the one made by Bonne Maman—in this snack cake; do not substitute a sweet marmalade. Dust with confectioners’ sugar before cutting, if desired."
