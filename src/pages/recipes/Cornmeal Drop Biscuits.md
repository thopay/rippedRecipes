ingredients: ["1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces), all-purpose flour","1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) stone-ground, cornmeal","3 tablespoons, sugar","2 teaspoons, baking powder","1/2 teaspoon, baking soda","3/4 teaspoon, salt","1 cup, buttermilk, chilled","8 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted and cooled"]
serves: 12
time: ""
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. Stir buttermilk and melted butter together in separate bowl until butter forms clumps.","Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated. Using greased 1/4-cup dry measuring cup or equal-size portion scoop, drop scant 1/4-cup scoops of batter 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared sheet (use spoon to free batter from cup if necessary).","Bake until biscuit tops are golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.

notes: "Be sure to chill the buttermilk so the
melted-and-cooled butter clumps when
the two are combined. These biscuits
are best eaten still warm from the oven;
try them spread with honey butter or
pimento cheese."
