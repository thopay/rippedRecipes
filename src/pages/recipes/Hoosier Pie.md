ingredients: ["1 (9-inch), store-bought pie dough round","1 cup (7 ounces), sugar","1/4 cup, cornstarch","1/4 teaspoon, salt","3 cups, heavy cream","5 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 5 pieces","1 tablespoon, vanilla extract",", ground nutmeg"]
serves: 10
time: "1¼ hours, plus 2 hours cooling and 2 hours chilling"
instructions: ["FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Roll dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch pie plate, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with your hand while pressing into plate bottom with your other hand.","Trim overhang to ½ inch beyond lip of plate. Tuck overhang under itself; folded edge should be flush with edge of plate. Crimp dough evenly around edge of plate using your fingers. Wrap dough-lined plate loosely in plastic wrap and freeze until dough is firm, about 15 minutes.","Line chilled pie shell with parchment paper or double layer of aluminum foil, covering edges to prevent burning, and fill with pie weights. Bake until edges are light golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating plate halfway through baking. Remove parchment and weights and continue to bake until crust is golden brown, 7 to 11 minutes longer. Transfer plate to wire rack. (Pie shell needn't cool completely before proceeding.)","FOR THE FILLING: Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in large saucepan. Whisk in cream until combined. Add butter and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick and large bubbles appear at surface, 6 to 8 minutes. Continue to whisk 20 seconds longer. Off heat, whisk in vanilla. Pour custard into pie shell and smooth top with rubber spatula. Let cool completely, about 2 hours, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours. Garnish with nutmeg and serve."]

notes: "The winner of our ready-made pie crusts tasting is Pillsbury Refrigerated Pie Crusts. We opt for store-bought pie crust in this recipe for convenience, but you can use any fully baked pie crust and proceed with the recipe from step 4."
