serves: 4
time: "1½ hours, plus 1 hour salting"
instructions: ["Place 1 chicken breast skin side down on cutting board, with ribs facing away from your knife hand. Run tip of knife between breastbone and meat, working from thick end of breast toward thin end. Angling blade slightly and following rib cage, repeat cutting motion several times to remove ribs and breastbone from breast. Find short remnant of wishbone along top edge of breast and run tip of knife along both sides of bone to separate from meat. Repeat with remaining 3 breasts.","Place coriander seeds and fennel seeds in zipper-lock bag and press or gently pound with skillet, rolling pin, or meat mallet until seeds are cracked.","Combine coriander seeds, fennel seeds, lemon zest, and pepper in small bowl. Transfer 1 teaspoon coriander seed mixture to second small bowl and set aside; add salt to remaining coriander seed mixture. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with salted coriander seed mixture. Transfer chicken skin side up to large plate and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Swirl 1 tablespoon oil evenly over surface of cold 12-inch skillet. Place chicken skin side down in skillet. Cook over medium-low heat until skin is deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Flip chicken skin side up; transfer skillet to oven; and cook until chicken registers 160 degrees, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer chicken to second large plate and let rest for 10 minutes.","Meanwhile, add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to juices left in skillet (skillet handle will be hot) and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add reserved coriander seed mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Off heat, whisk in lemon juice and chives, scraping up any browned bits. Slice chicken, transfer to serving platter, and drizzle with pan sauce. Serve."]

notes: "The chicken bones can be used to make stock, if desired. If you cant find bone-in split chicken breasts, boneless skin-on chicken breasts will work; look for breasts between 8 and 10 ounces each and skip step 1. Plan ahead: The salted chicken must be refrigerated for at least 1 hour before cooking. We prefer to use kosher salt to season the chicken; its larger grains make it easier to distribute evenly. If you use table salt, use half the amount (1¼ teaspoons)."
