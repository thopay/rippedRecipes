Add salt to remaining mixture in blender and process to dissolve, about 20 seconds.","Poke holes all over chicken with skewer. Place chicken in large zipper-lock bag, pour in salted marinade, seal bag, and turn to coat. Set bag in baking dish, breast side down, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn ­secondary burner(s) to low and ­primary burner to medium. (Adjust primary burner as needed to maintain grill temperature between 350 and 375 degrees.)","Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Discard used marinade. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken skin side down over cooler part of grill (over secondary burner(s) for gas), with legs closest to hotter side of grill. Cover and cook until chicken is well browned and thigh meat registers 160 degrees, 50 to 65 minutes. Brush chicken with half of reserved marinade. Flip chicken, move it to hot side of grill (over primary burner for gas), and brush with remaining half of reserved marinade. Cook, covered, until breasts register 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer.","Transfer chicken to cutting board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.
