instructions: ["Process cream in food processor until mixture transforms from grainy whipped cream to lumps of butter solids surrounded by cloudy buttermilk, 2 to 6 minutes.","Fill large bowl halfway with ice and water. Transfer contents of processor to fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl. Using rubber spatula, press and turn butter solids gently in strainer to extract as much liquid as possible, about 2 minutes.","Using your hands, press butter solids together into ball. Knead ball over strainer to squeeze out excess liquid, about 30 seconds. Transfer buttermilk collected in bowl to airtight container and reserve in refrigerator for another use. Wipe bowl clean with paper towels; set aside. Return butter to fine-mesh strainer and place strainer in ice bath (strainer will shield butter from ice) until butter has cooled and firmed up slightly, about 1 minute. Repeat process of kneading and dipping butter in ice bath until very little liquid can be squeezed out of butter, 2 to 3 times (knead butter over ice bath).","Transfer butter to now-empty medium bowl. Sprinkle salt evenly over butter, then knead butter until salt is thoroughly incorporated, about 30 seconds.","Transfer butter to butter dish or airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use. (Butter can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)"]

notes: "In step 1, the cream will increase in volume, thicken into a stiff whipped cream, and then turn grainy and decrease in volume before it separates into butter solids and buttermilk. This recipe will work with both pasteurized and ultra-pasteurized heavy cream. Pasteurized cream will turn to butter more quickly than ultra-pasteurized cream. The buttermilk from this recipe is much more like low-fat milk than cultured buttermilk, which has a tangy, almost sour flavor. You can use this milk as you would any low-fat milk."
