instructions: ["Dissolve 1½ tablespoons salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.","Drain beans in colander and rinse well. Combine beans, 10 cups fresh water, and 1 tablespoon salt in Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook at gentle simmer until beans are barely al dente, 40 to 50 minutes. (During simmer, bubbles should just break surface of water.)","Turn off heat, cover pot, and let beans steep until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain beans in colander. (Beans can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 3 days. Alternatively, beans can be cooled, transferred to zipper-lock bags, and frozen for up to 1 month.)","Combine 4 tablespoons oil and garlic in 12-inch nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat until garlic begins to brown lightly at edges, about 3 minutes.","Add sage and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 3½ cups beans (reserve remainder for another use) and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and cook until just heated through, about 2 minutes.","Combine beans, 5 tablespoons water, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in food processor and process until smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.","Transfer bean dip to shallow serving dish and spread into even layer. Drizzle liberally with extra oil and sprinkle with parsley. Serve."]

notes: "Note that the beans need to be soaked for at least 8 hours before cooking. The texture of this dip can vary depending on the beans. If it seems too thick in the food processor, add extra water 1 tablespoon at a time, and adjust the seasoning at the end if necessary. Serve with crudites, crackers, or bread."
