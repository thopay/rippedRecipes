notes: "When purchasing lemons, choose large ones that give to gentle pressure; hard lemons have thicker skin and yield less juice. Lemons and limes are commonly waxed to prevent moisture loss, increase shelf life, and protect from bruising during shipping. Scrub them with a vegetable brush under running water to remove wax, or buy organic fruit. Don’t worry about the seeds in the extracted juice; the entire mixture is strained at the end of the recipe. Serve poured over ice, if desired. Note that we recommend chilling the lemonade for 1 hour prior to serving."
