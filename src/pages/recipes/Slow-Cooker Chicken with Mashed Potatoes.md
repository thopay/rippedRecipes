notes: "Be sure to use Yukon Gold or yellow potatoes here. Russet potatoes will discolor as they cook in the slow cooker. Broilers behave differently, hence the 5-minute range in the broiling time in step 5. Keep a close watch on the chicken as it broils; the skin can go from golden brown to burnt in just a few seconds. For an accurate measurement of boiling water, bring a kettle of water to a boil and then measure out the desired amount."
