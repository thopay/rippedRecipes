Cool mixture for several minutes.","Whisk sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, and vanilla together in medium bowl until combined, about 15 seconds. Whisk in chocolate mixture until smooth.

Using spatula or table knife, smooth chocolate evenly over top of brownies. Sprinkle with ground peppermint candies.

notes: "These brownies are moist and packed with chocolate flavor, but they wont crumble when you cut them. In fact, they hold up well enough to pack in a childs lunchbox or bring to a picnic or bake sale. Theyre pretty good at home, too, with a tall glass of milk. Make sure to use chips rather than chocolate in the frosting. Use a food processor to chop the peppermint candies."
