notes: "We prefer to use homemade sofrito and sazon, but you can use store-bought sofrito and/or sazon. If using store-bought products, taste the stew in step 4 before seasoning with salt and vinegar to taste. If you cant find jamon de cocinar, you can substitute an equal volume of chopped ham steak. Calabaza squash is typically sold precut in Latin and Asian grocery stores. Kabocha, butternut squash, or sugar pumpkin are good substitutes for calabaza (no need to peel the kabocha; butternut and pumpkin should be peeled). Serve with Arroz con Tocino or plain rice and with lime wedges, if desired."
