Remove dish from oven and sprinkle dip with remaining 1 teaspoon thyme. Let dip cool for 5 minutes. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 2, let dip cool completely, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

notes: "If you cant find fresh crab, refrigerated pasteurized crab is the next-best option. Lump, backfin (special), and claw meat all work well here. This recipe can easily be doubled to serve a crowd. For the best results, we recommend using good-quality aged cheddar cheese and shredding it on a box grater. The finished dip goes great with a little extra Worcestershire and some Tabasco sauce on top. Serve with toasted baguette slices or crackers."
