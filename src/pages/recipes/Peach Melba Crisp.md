serves: 6
time: "1¼ hours, plus 30 minutes macerating and 30 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE FILLING: Grind tapioca in spice grinder to fine powder, about 30 seconds. Gently toss peaches with sugar and salt in bowl and let sit, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Drain peaches through colander set inside bowl; reserve peach juice. Return drained peaches to original bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons reserved peach juice, ground tapioca, lemon juice, and vanilla. Transfer to 8-inch square baking dish and press gently into even layer. Top peaches with raspberries.","FOR THE TOPPING: While peaches are macerating, combine flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in food processor and process until combined, about 15 seconds. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles wet sand, about 8 pulses. Add oats and pecans and pulse until mixture forms marble-size clumps and no loose flour remains, about 15 pulses. Chill mixture for at least 15 minutes. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.","Distribute topping evenly over fruit. Bake until topping is well browned and fruit is bubbling around edges, about 30 minutes, rotating dish halfway through baking. Cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Serve."]
