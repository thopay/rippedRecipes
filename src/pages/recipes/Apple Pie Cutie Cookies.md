instructions: ["FOR THE PASTRY: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, butter, 1½ teaspoons sugar, and salt and beat on low speed until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 3 minutes. Add ice water and mix until dough begins to come together, about 1 minute, adding extra water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into 4-inch square, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Combine cinnamon and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in small bowl; set aside.","FOR THE FILLING: Combine water and cornstarch in small bowl. Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll 1 square of dough into 12 by 8-inch rectangle, ¼ inch thick, on lightly floured counter. Spread evenly with apple mixture.","Roll remaining dough into 12 by 8-inch rectangle, ¼ inch thick. Using fluted pastry wheel, cut dough into sixteen 12 by ½-inch strips. Arrange dough strips diagonally in lattice pattern over filling, trimming as needed.","Cut into twenty-four 2-inch squares, brush tops with egg, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Space cookies 1 inch apart on prepared sheets. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until golden, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through baking; refrigerate second sheet while first is baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheets. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.)"]
