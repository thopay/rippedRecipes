serves: 6
time: "3 hours, plus 17 hours salting and resting"
instructions: ["Place brisket, fat side down, on cutting board and cut in half lengthwise with grain. Sprinkle meat evenly on all sides with 2½ teaspoons salt on each piece (5 teaspoons salt total). Wrap each half in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 16 hours or up to 2 days.","Using highest saute function, heat oil in Instant Pot until just smoking. Unwrap brisket halves. Place 1 brisket half fat side down in Instant Pot and cook until well browned, about 8 minutes. Flip brisket and cook until well browned on second side, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to large plate. Repeat with second brisket half; transfer to plate.","Add onions and remaining 1 tablespoon salt to fat left in pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, pepper, cinnamon, ground ginger, and cloves and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in broth, honey, and bay leaves, scraping up any browned bits.","Nestle brisket halves into onion mixture (pieces may overlap), adding any accumulated juices. Lock lid into place and close pressure-release valve. Select high pressure-cook function and cook for 1 hour 5 minutes.","Turn off Instant Pot and let pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick-release any remaining pressure and let brisket sit in pot, covered, for 1 hour. Carefully remove lid, allowing any steam to escape away from you.","Transfer brisket to carving board and tent with aluminum foil. Discard bay leaves. Add carrots, sweet potatoes, and prunes to cooking liquid in pot and bring to boil using highest saute function. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and sauce is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.","Slice brisket against grain ¼ inch thick and arrange slices on serving platter. Stir vinegar into vegetables. Spoon 2 cups vegetables and sauce over brisket and sprinkle with parsley. Serve, passing remaining vegetables and sauce separately."]

notes: "This recipe was developed with Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt. If you have Morton Kosher Salt, which is denser than Diamond Crystal, reduce the salt in step 1 to 3¾ teaspoons total and the salt in step 3 to 2¼ teaspoons. Plan ahead: The brisket must be seasoned at least 16 hours before cooking. Naturally releasing the pressure and then resting the brisket in the turned-off Instant Pot for an hour allows the meat to soak up some of the liquid it lost during cooking, leading to a moister, more sliceable texture. When using the highest saute function, we prefer not to use the Instant Pots built-in timer because the heat turns off once the time is up. Instead, we set the pots timer to longer than well need, set an external timer for cooking times indicated in the recipe, and follow visual cues to judge when to continue to the next step."
