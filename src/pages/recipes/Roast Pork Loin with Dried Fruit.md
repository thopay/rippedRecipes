Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Unwrap roast and place fat side up on prepared wire rack. Roast until center registers 130 degrees, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer roast to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest for 30 minutes.","Meanwhile, combine ¼ cup water and cornstarch in bowl; set aside.

notes: "White sugar can be substituted for the brown sugar in the sauce and on the pork. A blade-end roast is our preferred cut, but a center-cut boneless pork loin roast can also be used. This recipe requires refrigerating the salted meat for at least 1 hour before cooking."
