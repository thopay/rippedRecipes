description: "Most burgers dry out if you cook them beyond medium-rare. Not these. Steamed burgers stay incredibly juicy and moist even when cooked to medium-well."

notes: "The test kitchen’s favorite steamer basket is the Progressive Easy Reach Steamer Basket. We prefer these burgers cooked medium-well, but for medium burgers, steam them for 7 minutes before shutting off the heat and adding the cheese. Serve these burgers with the usual array of garnishes and condiments: lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard."
