notes: "Pork shoulder—usually labeled pork butt or Boston butt—comes either boneless or on the bone. If using bone-in pork shoulder, buy a 6- to 6½-pound roast. When trimming excess fat, leave at least 1/8-inch thickness on the exterior. Serve the finished dish over rice or with warm corn tortillas."
