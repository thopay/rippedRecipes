serves: 14
time: "50 minutes, plus 35 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 12-inch cast-iron skillet.","Combine marshmallows, warm tap water, butter, unsweetened chocolate, and cocoa in large bowl. Microwave at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth, 2 to 4 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.","Whisk in sugar, oil, eggs and yolks, and vanilla until fully combined. Gently whisk in flour and salt until just incorporated. Stir in bittersweet chocolate.","Transfer batter to prepared skillet. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out with few moist crumbs and batter attached (be careful not to overbake; brownie will continue to bake as it cools), 33 to 38 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking.

notes: "In step 3, you can substitute bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips for the chopped bittersweet chocolate, if desired, but the chips won’t melt as much as the chopped chocolate and will be less gooey. We suggest serving the warm brownies with ice cream; cooled brownies can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored for up to four days."
