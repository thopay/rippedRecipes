ingredients: ["1/2 cup, dried cherries, chopped coarse","2 tablespoons, Grand Marnier","4 ounces dried, ladyfingers (savoiardi), cut into 1⁄2-inch chunks","1 cup (6 ounces), semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips","1/3 cup, heavy cream","Pinch, salt","2/3 cup, pistachios, toasted","1/2 cup (2 ounces), confectioners' sugar"]
serves: 24
time: "40 minutes, plus 3 hours chilling"
instructions: ["Combine cherries and Grand Marnier in small bowl and microwave until hot, about 30 seconds; let sit until cherries have softened and mixture is cool, about 15 minutes. Reserve 1 cup ladyfingers. Process remaining ladyfingers in food processor to fine crumbs, 15 to 20 seconds. (You should have about 3/4 cup.)","Microwave chocolate chips and cream in medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, 30 to 60 seconds. Add salt and ladyfinger crumbs and stir to combine. Add pistachios, reserved ladyfingers, and cherry mixture and stir until thick dough forms.","Divide dough in half and place each half on large sheet of plastic wrap. Use plastic to roll each dough into tight 6-inch log, twisting ends well to secure. Refrigerate dough logs until firm, at least 3 hours. (Chilled dough can be stored in refrigerator for up to 3 days.)","When ready to serve, place confectioners’ sugar in shallow dish. Unwrap dough logs and roll in sugar until well coated, brushing off excess. Cut each log into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve."]

notes: "There’s nothing savory about this confection rooted in Portuguese and Italian tradition. With a base akin to a chocolate truffle, it’s typically chock-full of dried fruit, nuts, and crushed cookies. To complete the salami look, the dough is rolled into logs before being dredged in confectioners’ sugar. We liked the combination of dried cherries (first macerated in Grand Marnier) and pistachios, and we used dried ladyfingers as the cookie component—although any dry, biscuit- like cookie will work."
