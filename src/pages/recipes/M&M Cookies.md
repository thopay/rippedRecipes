ingredients: ["2 1/4 cups (11¼ ounces), all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon, table salt","3/4 teaspoon, baking soda","12 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted","1 cup packed (7 ounces), light brown sugar","1/2 cup (3½ ounces), granulated sugar","1 , large egg plus 1 large yolk","2 teaspoons, vanilla extract","1 1/4 cups (9 ounces), M&M's"]
serves: 16
time: "55 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in bowl.","Whisk melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in large bowl until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Whisk in egg and yolk and vanilla until fully combined and mixture looks emulsified, about 30 seconds. Stir in half of flour mixture with rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Stir in candies and remaining flour mixture.","Divide dough into sixteen 2¼-ounce portions, about 2 heaping tablespoons each; divide any remaining dough evenly among dough portions. Roll dough portions between your hands to make smooth balls.","Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 8 balls per sheet. Using your hand, flatten balls to ¾-inch thickness.","Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until centers of cookies are puffed and still very blond, about 8 minutes; cookies will seem underdone. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.","TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 4, transfer flattened dough balls to parchment paper–lined plate and freeze until very firm, at least 1 hour. Transfer balls to 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Bake from frozen, increasing baking time to 12 minutes."]

notes: "Use standard, not mini, M&amp;M’s in this recipe. The cookies will seem underdone when you pull them from the oven. This is OK; they will continue baking as they cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. This method ensures that the cookies remain chewy once they are cooled."
