Set aside.","Microwave chocolate and water in large bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally with rubber spatula, until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes.","Whisk one-third of egg mixture into chocolate mixture until fully combined. Using clean rubber spatula, gently fold in remaining egg mixture, making sure to scrape up any chocolate from bottom of bowl, until no streaks remain.","Portion mousse evenly into 6 to 8 serving glasses or ramekins, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 48 hours.","FOR THE WHIPPED CREAM: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute.

notes: "If using pasteurized eggs here, increase the high-speed whipping time to 8 to 10 minutes. To bring the eggs to room temperature quickly, place the whole, uncracked eggs in a bowl of warm water for 15 minutes. We developed this recipe using Ghirardelli 60% Premium Baking Chips. We call for individual serving glasses or ramekins, but this mousse can also be chilled in a large serving dish. Just increase the chilling time to at least 8 hours."
