ingredients: ["4 ounces, ginger, peeled","1/2 cup, unseasoned rice vinegar","3 tablespoons, sugar","1 1/2 teaspoons, table salt"]
serves: 10
time: "20 minutes, plus 3 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Fill one 8-ounce jar with hot water; set aside. Using mandoline, slice ginger paper-thin.","Bring ginger, vinegar, sugar, and salt to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar and to make sure all ginger slices get exposed to hot vinegar mixture. Once sugar is dissolved, immediately remove from heat.","Discard water in jar and shake dry. Using tongs, transfer ginger to jar, then pour brine over top to fill jar, leaving ½ inch of headspace. Let cool completely, about 1 hour.","Once cool, affix jar lid and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. (Pickled ginger can be refrigerated for at least 3 months; ginger flavor will mellow over time.)"]

notes: "The ginger should be refrigerated in its brine for at least 2 hours before serving, but letting it sit overnight is recommended. For the best flavor and texture, we recommend using fresh, young ginger, if available. Young ginger has thin, taut skin that can be easily scraped off with a spoon or paring knife. This pickled ginger cannot be processed for long-term storage. Its important to slice the ginger as thin as possible; a mandoline does the best job of this."
