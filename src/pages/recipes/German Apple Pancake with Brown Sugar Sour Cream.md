notes: "You can substitute low-fat or skim milk for the whole milk, if desired, but the pancake will taste slightly eggier. You will need a 12-inch ovensafe skillet for this recipe. We do not recommend using a nonstick or cast-iron skillet here, as the bottom of the pancake will get too dark. The pancake will puff up during baking and deflate shortly after it comes out of the oven—thats supposed to happen. The interior will be no less delicious."
