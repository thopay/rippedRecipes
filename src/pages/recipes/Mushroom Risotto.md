serves: 4
time: "1 hour 5 minutes"
instructions: ["Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add cremini mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper. Cover and cook until mushrooms release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all liquid has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes longer.","Add 4 tablespoons butter, shallots, porcini mushrooms, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently with wooden spoon, until grains are translucent around edges, about 2 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring constantly and scraping up any browned bits, until wine is fully absorbed, about 2 minutes.","Stir in 3 cups water, thyme, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Stir, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until almost all liquid has been absorbed and rice is just al dente, about 12 minutes, stirring twice during cooking.","Add remaining 1 cup water and cook, stirring constantly, until risotto is creamy, about 3 minutes. Off heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes (risotto will continue to thicken as it sits).","Stir in Parmesan, parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Risotto should have consistency of loose oatmeal; wooden spoon dragged through mixture should leave trail that takes about 3 seconds to fill in. Adjust consistency with small increments of warm water as needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, sprinkled with extra parsley."]

notes: "You can substitute white mushrooms for the cremini mushrooms and chanterelle or oyster mushrooms for the shiitakes, if desired. If the mushroom caps are larger than 2 inches in diameter, cut them into six pieces. One and a half cups of Arborio rice weighs about 11 ounces."
