serves: 54
time: "1½ hours, plus 2 hours chilling and 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in bowl. With electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg until incorporated. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until dough forms, about 1 minute. Remove half of dough from bowl and reserve. Add extracts, candy, and food coloring to remaining dough and mix until combined.","Place reserved dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll into 14 by 8-inch rectangle. Repeat with peppermint dough, then place on top of plain dough and press gently to adhere. With long side facing you, roll dough into log. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice chilled dough into 1/4-inch rounds and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake until edges are just golden, 12 to 14 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool 10 minutes on sheet, then transfer to wire rack and cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.)"]
