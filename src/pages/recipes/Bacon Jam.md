instructions: ["Cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, 15 to 18 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate; set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet.","Heat fat left in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, thyme sprigs, and garlic and cook until onion is softened and browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in water, vinegar, maple syrup, cayenne, and reserved bacon. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly all liquid has evaporated and mixture begins to sizzle loudly, 22 to 28 minutes.","Remove from heat and let cool for 15 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs.

notes: "Do not use thick-cut bacon in this recipe. We like cider vinegar here, but you can experiment with other vinegars if you like. You can use more or less cayenne to suit your preferences; the ⅛ teaspoon we call for provides just a hint of heat."
