notes: "We prefer to use Yukon Gold potatoes in this recipe; however, small Red Bliss potatoes will work. For the best results, use small Yukon Gold potatoes measuring 1 to 1½ inches in diameter. Be sure to pat the roasted red peppers dry with paper towels before chopping them; any excess moisture will water down the dressing."
