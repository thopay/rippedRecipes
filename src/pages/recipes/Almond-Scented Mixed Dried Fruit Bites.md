Combine apples, figs, cherries, raisins, ¼ cup amaretto, and water in small saucepan over medium heat and bring to simmer. Immediately remove from heat and let steep for 15 minutes. Strain through fine-mesh strainer, discarding liquid.","Combine flour, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and ginger in bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, marmalade, and almond extract and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low and add half of flour mixture. Add nuts, fruit, and remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Give batter final stir by hand. Fill each muffin cup with 2 tablespoons batter.","Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees. Continue to bake cookies until firm and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating muffin tin(s) halfway through baking. Brush cookies with remaining 4 teaspoons amaretto while still hot. Let cool completely in muffin tin(s). Dust with confectioners’ sugar just before serving.
