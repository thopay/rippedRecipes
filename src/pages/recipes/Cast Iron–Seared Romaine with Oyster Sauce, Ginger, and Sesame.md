serves: 6
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Whisk scallion whites, oyster sauce, ginger, lemon juice, water, sesame oil, and garlic together in small bowl; set dressing aside.","Line rimmed baking sheet with dish towel. Trim root ends from romaine hearts, leaving bases intact so that layers stay together. Cut romaine hearts in half lengthwise. Rinse thoroughly between layers to remove any dirt. Transfer romaine to prepared sheet, cut sides down, and pat dry with second dish towel.","Heat 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. Brush romaine evenly with vegetable oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place half of romaine, cut sides down and alternating directions, in pan and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes. Flip romaine and cook until second sides are spotty brown and leaves are softened, about 1 minute. Transfer to serving platter, cut sides up. Repeat with remaining romaine.","Drizzle half of dressing over romaine. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, chile, and scallion greens. Serve, passing remaining dressing separately."]

notes: "Look for tight, dense romaine hearts that are heavy for their size; larger heads can be peeled down to the correct weight. You can substitute other fresh chiles, such as jalapenos, for the Thai chile, or simply omit them if you prefer a milder dish."
