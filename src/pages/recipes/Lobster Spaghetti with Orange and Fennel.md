Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Drain pasta and return it to pot.","Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, fennel bulb, and salt and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, garlic, and orange zest and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ouzo and simmer until evaporated, about 4 minutes. Stir in lobster meat and reserved clam juice mixture and simmer until lobster is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
