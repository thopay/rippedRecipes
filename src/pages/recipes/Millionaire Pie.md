description: "This pie is so named because its rich (from eggs and cream), its gold (from lots of crushed pineapple), and its supposed to taste like a million bucks. In our recipe, we move the pecans from the filling to the cookie crust to produce a smooth, fluffy filling free from distracting chunks."

instructions: ["For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grind cookies and pecans in food processor to fine crumbs. Add butter and pulse until combined. Press crumbs into bottom and sides of 9-inch pie plate and refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes. Bake until lightly browned and set, about 15 minutes. Cool completely.","For the pie: Cook crushed pineapple, 1/4 cup sugar, and pinch salt in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates and pineapple is lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Scrape mixture into food processor and process until very smooth, about 1 minute; set aside.","Whisk yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Combine gelatin and 1/2 cup pineapple juice concentrate in medium saucepan and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Cook over medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture is very hot but not boiling, about 2 minutes. Whisking vigorously, slowly add gelatin mixture to egg yolks. Return mixture to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in remaining 1/2 cup pineapple juice concentrate and processed pineapple mixture. Pour into clean large bowl and refrigerate until set, about 1 1/2 hours.","With electric mixer on medium-high speed, whip cream and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar to stiff peaks, about 3 minutes. Whisk 1 cup whipped cream into gelatin mixture until completely incorporated. Using rubber spatula, fold additional 1 cup whipped cream into gelatin mixture until no streaks of white remain. Scrape mixture into cooled pie shell and smooth top. Spread remaining whipped cream evenly over filling and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours. Serve."]
