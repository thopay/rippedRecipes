ingredients: ["6 tablespoons, unsalted butter","3 tablespoons, whole milk","1/4 teaspoon, salt","1/4 cup (1/2 ounces) plain, instant mashed potato flakes","1 teaspoon, vanilla extract","1 1/2 cups (6 ounces), confectioners' sugar","1 1/2 cups (4 1/2 ounces), sweetened shredded coconut","1 pound, bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine"]
serves: 14
time: "40 minutes, plus 2 hours 25 minutes chilling"
instructions: ["Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 1 long sheet of aluminum foil so it is 8 inches wide. Lay foil sheet in pan with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.","Microwave butter, milk, and salt in medium bowl until butter is melted and mixture is bubbling, about 2 minutes. Stir in potato flakes and vanilla until mixture resembles applesauce, about 30 seconds (mixture will look oily). Stir in sugar and coconut until no dry spots remain and mixture forms loose paste.","Transfer coconut mixture to prepared pan and, using rubber spatula, press firmly into thin, even layer reaching into corners of pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.","Flip coconut mixture onto cutting board; discard foil. Cut into 36 (1-inch) squares (5 horizontal cuts by 5 vertical cuts). Separate squares into 2 batches and keep half refrigerated while working with other half. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.","Microwave 12 ounces chocolate in medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring with rubber spatula every 15 seconds, until about two-thirds melted, about 1½ minutes (chocolate should still be lumpy). Remove bowl from microwave and add remaining 4 ounces chocolate. Stir and mash until chocolate is just melted and smooth, about 3 minutes. (If lumps remain, you may return chocolate to microwave at 50 percent power for no more than 5 seconds at a time, stirring at each interval, until fully melted.)","Drop several coconut squares into chocolate. Using 2 forks, gently flip squares to coat on all sides. One at a time, use fork to lift squares from chocolate. Tap fork against edge of bowl and then wipe underside of fork on edge of bowl to remove excess chocolate from bottom of candy. Use second fork to slide candy onto prepared sheet.","Repeat with remaining coconut squares and remaining chocolate, cleaning forks as needed. (As chocolate begins to set, microwave it at 50 percent power for no more than 5 seconds at a time, stirring at each interval, until fluid. Expect to microwave chocolate at least twice during coating process.)","Refrigerate candy until chocolate is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve. (Candy can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 1 week.)"]

notes: "We prefer Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Premium Baking Bars here. For the coating to set properly, you must chop the chocolate fine and then melt it gently and slowly in the microwave, stirring often so it heats evenly. In step 5, the chocolate will still be lumpy; do not be tempted to microwave it until completely smooth. The residual heat from the bowl, along with continued stirring and mashing with a rubber spatula, should melt the remaining chocolate plus any leftover lumps. The chocolate is divided here, so if you dont have a scale, note that each Ghirardelli bar weighs 4 ounces. Do not use chocolate chips in this recipe."
