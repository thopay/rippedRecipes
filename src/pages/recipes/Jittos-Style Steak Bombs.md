notes: "Sirloin steak tips are often sold as flap meat. Lawrys Seasoned Salt is usually stocked with other spice blends in the grocery store. We developed this recipe with a red bell pepper, but any color pepper can be used. Keep the sub rolls hinged when splitting them; otherwise, these extra-full sandwiches have a tendency to fall apart when fully assembled."
