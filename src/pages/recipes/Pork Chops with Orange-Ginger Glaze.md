notes: "You can easily obtain wide strips of orange zest by using a vegetable peeler. Frank’s RedHot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce gives this recipe a kick, but if you’re using a hotter brand, such as Tabasco, reduce the amount to just 1 teaspoon to keep it from overpowering the rest of the ingredients."
