notes: "This strawberry sauce pairs perfectly with our basic Icebox Cheesecake, but it also goes nicely with the Key lime variation (and it makes a great sauce for ice cream). Frozen strawberries work well in this recipe, but if you can find fresh, very ripe berries, by all means, use them instead. Be sure to stir the strawberries gently so that they do not break down completely--large chunks of strawberries are very appealing. You can make this sauce up to 2 days in advance."
