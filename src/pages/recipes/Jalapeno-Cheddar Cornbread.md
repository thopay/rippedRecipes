notes: "We developed this recipe using fine-ground cornmeal. Our favorite is Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Cornmeal; however, more commonly available Quaker Yellow Cornmeal will work just fine here. Do not use coarse-ground cornmeal. Do not use mild or regular sharp cheddar cheese in this recipe, as its flavor doesn’t stand out like that of extra-sharp cheddar. You can use an 8-inch square baking pan instead of a 9-inch round cake pan. If you use a dark-colored cake pan, reduce the baking time in step 3 to 30 to 35 minutes."
