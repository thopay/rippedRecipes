Make foil sling for pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with oil spray. Combine flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, almonds, and salt in food processor. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Press mixture firmly into prepared pan. Bake until light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool completely.","For the filling: With electric mixer on medium speed, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg and extracts until incorporated, about 1 minute.","Spread preserves over cooled crust, leaving 1/2-inch border around edge. Dollop tablespoonfuls of cream cheese mixture over jam and spread into even layer.","Bake until slightly puffed, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan. Cut into 2-inch squares."]
