notes: "This may seem like a lot of anchovies, and it is, but their flavor mellows as they cook. Note that we do not drain the canned tomatoes before adding them to the sauce. One 2-ounce can of anchovies equals roughly 1½ tablespoons once chopped. You can substitute other types of white fish, such as cod, haddock, and hake, for the halibut, if desired. Serve with crusty bread."
