notes: "Make sure that you have all the ingredients prepped and ready to go when you start cooking. For the best results, you’ll need to flow seamlessly through the recipe steps. Oil-packed tuna comes in a variety of can and jar sizes, hence the weight range in the ingredient list. Use a product you like that fits your budget."
