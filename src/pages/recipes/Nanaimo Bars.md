time: "40 minutes, plus 2½ hours chilling, plus 20 minutes tempering"
instructions: ["FOR THE CRUST: Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.","Microwave chocolate chips in bowl at 50 percent power until melted, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Process cracker pieces, coconut, pecans, cocoa, and salt in food processor until cracker pieces are finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add corn syrup and melted chocolate and pulse until combined, 8 to 10 pulses (mixture should hold together when pinched with your fingers). Transfer to prepared pan. Using bottom of greased measuring cup, press crumbs into bottom of pan. Refrigerate while making filling.","FOR THE FILLING: In clean, dry food processor, process sugar, butter, milk powder, and salt until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add cream and vanilla and process until fully combined, about 15 seconds. Spread filling evenly over crust. Cover pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until filling is set and firm, about 2 hours.","FOR THE TOPPING: Microwave chocolate chips, butter, and corn syrup in bowl at 50 percent power until chocolate chips and butter are melted and mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Using offset spatula, spread chocolate mixture evenly over set filling. Refrigerate until topping is set, about 30 minutes.","Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting board; discard foil. Using chef’s knife, trim outer ¼ inch of square to make neat edges (wipe knife clean with dish towel after each cut). Cut square into thirds to create 3 rectangles. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 6 equal pieces. Let bars sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving. (Nanaimo bars can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "For bars with tidy edges, be sure to wipe your knife clean with a dish towel after each cut. We developed this recipe with Ghirardelli 60% Premium Baking Chips."
