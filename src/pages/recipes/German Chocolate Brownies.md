time: ""
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 8-inch baking dish with foil and coat foil with cooking spray.","Melt chocolate and butter in small bowl in microwave or in heatproof bowl set over pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally to combine. Cool mixture for several minutes.","Whisk sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, and vanilla together in medium bowl until combined, about 15 seconds. Whisk in chocolate mixture until smooth. Stir in flour until no streaks of flour remain. Scrape batter evenly into prepared pan.","Bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center of pan comes out clean, 22 to 27 minutes. While brownies are baking, heat medium skillet over medium heat and toast coconut until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.","Remove brownies from oven, sprinkle with butterscotch chips, and let sit until the chips are softened but not melted, about 5 minutes. Using spatula or table knife, smooth chips evenly over top of brownies. Sprinkle with toasted coconut. Cool brownies on wire rack until topping has firmed up, about 2 hours.","Using foil, lift brownies from pan to cutting board. Slide foil out from under brownies and cut brownies into 2-inch squares. (Brownies can be stored in airtight container for several days.)"]

notes: "These brownies are moist and packed with chocolate flavor, but they wont crumble when you cut them. In fact, they hold up well enough to pack in a childs lunchbox or bring to a picnic or bake sale. Theyre pretty good at home, too, with a tall glass of milk. The cake of the same name inspired this recipe."
