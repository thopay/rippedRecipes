Bake chicken until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.","Meanwhile, discard fat in skillet. Melt butter in empty skillet over high heat until foaming. Add mushrooms and leeks and cook until mushroom liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook until almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Add broth and 1 tablespoon tarragon and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in goat cheese and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Add remaining tarragon and season with salt and pepper.","Return chicken to skillet and turn to coat with sauce. Serve."]
