Broil until asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. Arrange muffins split side up on platter. Divide asparagus and salmon evenly among muffin halves.","Cook 16 tablespoons butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until butter registers 190 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. Process egg yolks, lemon juice, cayenne, and ¼ teaspoon salt in blender until frothy, about 10 seconds. With blender running, slowly drizzle in hot butter until fully emulsified, about 2 minutes. Adjust consistency with hot water as needed and season with salt to taste. Cover to keep warm.","Fill now-empty skillet nearly to rim with water. Add vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil over high heat. Crack remaining 8 eggs into liquid measuring cup. Gently tip eggs into water, one at a time, leaving space between them. Off heat, cover skillet and poach eggs until whites are set but yolks are slightly runny, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, remove eggs from skillet and arrange on prepared muffin halves. Spoon hollandaise over each egg. Serve."]
