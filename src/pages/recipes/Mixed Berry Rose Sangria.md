notes: "Use a dry rose wine that isn’t too expensive but one that you would enjoy drinking on its own. Most raspberries and blueberries come in 6-ounce containers, but if you can find only 5-ounce containers, you don’t need to buy a second container to make up the extra ounce. We prefer the flavor of mixed berries here, but you can also use a single variety of berry or swap in blackberries, as long as the total amount still equals 17 ounces. You can substitute a different orange liqueur for the Grand Marnier, if desired."
