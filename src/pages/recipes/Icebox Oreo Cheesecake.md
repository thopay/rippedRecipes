title: Icebox Oreo Cheesecake

description: "The idea of a no-bake Oreo cheesecake is especially appealing in the summer months because there is no hot oven and no messy water bath. Gelatin-based cheesecakes are easy to prepare, but their texture is never quite as creamy as that of an egg-thickened baked cheesecake. We set out to create an icebox Oreo cheesecake that would rival the best baked cheesecake for flavor and texture."
