ingredients: ["7 , whole graham crackers, broken into rough pieces","1/2 cup (2½ ounces), all-purpose flour","1/4 cup packed (1¾ ounces), brown sugar","1/2 teaspoon, table salt","8 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces and chilled","6 (1.55-ounce), Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bars, divided","1 cup, marshmallow creme","1 1/2 cups mini, marshmallows"]
serves: 16
time: "1½ hours, plus 4 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Generously spray foil with vegetable oil spray.","Process cracker pieces in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add flour, sugar, and salt and pulse to combine, about 5 pulses. Add butter and pulse until mixture is uniform and resembles wet sand, about 20 pulses. Press dough into even layer in bottom of prepared pan. Bake until crust is set and well browned around edges, about 13 minutes. Let cool completely. (Cooled crust can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.)","Cover crust with 5 chocolate bars, breaking bars as necessary to create even layer (you will have some chocolate left over). Chop remaining chocolate fine and set aside. Spray offset spatula with oil spray. Using prepared spatula, spread marshmallow creme over chocolate. Sprinkle marshmallows evenly over marshmallow creme.","Bake bars until edges are set and marshmallows are puffed and dark brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and sprinkle with chopped chocolate. Let bars cool until chocolate is set, at least 4 hours.","Lightly spray chef's knife with oil spray. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan. (Marshmallows may stick to foil. Use knife to separate, if necessary.) Cut bars into 16 squares. Serve. (Do not cut bars until ready to serve. Bars can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "We developed this recipe using Fluff brand marshmallow creme. Hersheys Milk Chocolate bars are best here; if youre using our favorite milk chocolate from Endangered Species, use four 3-ounce bars. Note that the baked smores bars need to cool for about 4 hours to set the chocolate; if youre in a hurry, you can put the bars in the refrigerator for 1 hour, but dont refrigerate them for much longer because the crust will become too hard."
