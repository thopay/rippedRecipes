serves: 6
time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Halve cabbage through core. Cut each half into 3 approximately 2 1/2-inch wedges through core, leaving core intact (you should have 6 wedges).","Combine 1/4 cup water and oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Arrange wedges in single layer in skillet, 1 cut side down. Sprinkle wedges with 1 teaspoon salt and cook over medium heat, uncovered, until water has evaporated and wedges are well browned, 16 to 20 minutes.","Flip wedges to second cut side, add remaining 2 tablespoons water to pan, and cook, covered, until wedges are tender and second side is well browned, 4 to 6 minutes longer.","Evenly scatter butter among wedges and cook, uncovered, until butter is melted and bubbling, about 1 minute. Evenly sprinkle basil, caraway, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper over wedges. Continue to cook, using large spoon halfway through cooking to baste wedges with melted butter (tilting skillet so butter pools at low point and can be easily scooped into spoon), until fragrant, about 1 minute.","Transfer wedges to serving platter. Off heat, stir lemon juice into any remaining butter in skillet, then spoon over wedges. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve."]

notes: "When slicing the cabbage into wedges, be sure to leave the core intact so the wedges don’t fall apart when being flipped in step 3. Be sure not to buy a head of cabbage that weighs more than 2 pounds. If you do, the wedges will not fit in the skillet."
