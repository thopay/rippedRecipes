notes: "These brownies are moist and packed with chocolate flavor, but they wont crumble when you cut them. In fact, they hold up well enough to pack in a childs lunchbox or bring to a picnic or bake sale. Theyre pretty good at home, too, with a tall glass of milk. Semisweet chips are fine for this frosting. If youre anxious to firm up the frosting, pop the tray of frosted brownies into the refrigerator for 15 minutes."
