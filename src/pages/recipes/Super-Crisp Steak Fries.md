description: "Though less finicky than french fries, steak fries involve a fair amount of hot oil and good technique. The microwave plays an important role in our recipe for crispy fries with a light, fluffy interior."

serves: 6
time: ""
instructions: ["In large microwave-proof bowl, toss potato wedges with 1/4 cup oil. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and microwave on high until potatoes are completely tender but not falling apart, 8 to 12 minutes, tossing them (without removing the plastic) halfway through cooking time. (Microwave times vary, so check potatoes for doneness at 6 minutes.) Carefully remove plastic wrap (beware of steam) and drain. Gently spread potatoes out over several layers of paper towels. Pat dry and let cool 10 minutes. Gently peel potatoes from paper towels and transfer to large plate. (Potatoes can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)","Heat remaining 4 3/4 cups oil (it should measure about 1 inch deep) in large Dutch oven or other wide, deep pot over high heat to 375 degrees.","When oil is ready, add cornstarch and stir to disperse. Add half of potatoes and fry, stirring and prodding to keep them from sticking together, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove fries from oil using slotted spoon or wire spider and transfer to baking sheet lined with paper towels. Lightly pat potatoes dry with paper towels. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining potato wedges. When second batch is golden brown, return first batch to pot and continue to fry until all potatoes are deeply golden with dark brown edges, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer fries to fresh layers of paper towels, pat dry, and season with salt and pepper (or one of the flavored salts--see related recipes) to taste. Serve."]

notes: "Do not let the potatoes cool completely on paper towels in step 1; they may stick. Keeping the oil at the correct temperature is essential for producing crisp fries. Use a deep-fry thermometer to check the temperature of the oil before you add the potatoes."
