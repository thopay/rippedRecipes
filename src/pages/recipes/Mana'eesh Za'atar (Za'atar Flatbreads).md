instructions: ["FOR THE DOUGH: Process flour, yeast, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Combine cold water and oil in liquid measuring cup. With processor running, slowly add water mixture and process until dough forms sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 30 to 60 seconds.","Transfer dough to clean counter and knead into cohesive ball, about 1 minute. Place dough in greased bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 2 to 2½ hours. One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to middle position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.","FOR THE TOPPING: Meanwhile, combine za’atar, oil, and salt in bowl.","On clean counter, divide dough into 3 equal pieces, about 7 ounces each. Shape each piece of dough into ball; cover loosely with plastic and let rest for 15 minutes.","Working with 1 dough ball at a time on lightly floured counter, coat lightly with flour and flatten into 6- to 7-inch disk using your fingertips.","Using rolling pin, roll dough into 9- to 10-inch circle. Slide dough round onto floured baking peel. Spread one-third of za’atar mixture (about 1½ tablespoons) over surface of dough with back of dinner spoon, stopping ½ inch from edge.","Firmly tap dough all over with your fingertips, about 6 times. Slide dough onto baking stone and bake until lightly bubbled and brown on top, about 5 minutes. Using baking peel, transfer man’oushe to wire rack. Repeat with remaining dough and za’atar mixture. Slice or tear and serve."]
