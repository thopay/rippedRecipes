ingredients: ["2 pounds, ground lamb","2 teaspoons, table salt","1½ teaspoons, ground cumin","1 teaspoon, pepper","½ teaspoon, ground cinnamon","4 , brioche hamburger buns, toasted and buttered"]
serves: 4
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Divide lamb into four 8-ounce portions and roll between your hands to form balls. Working on baking sheet, press each ball into 4½-inch-diameter patty, about ¾ inch thick. Using your thumb or fingers, make 1-inch-wide by ¼-inch-deep depression in center of each patty. (Patties can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours at this point.)","Transfer patties to platter and freeze until firm but not frozen solid, 30 to 45 minutes. Combine salt, cumin, pepper, and cinnamon in bowl; set aside.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4½ quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Sprinkle patties on both sides with spice mixture (use all of it), using spatula to flip patties so they don't become misshapen.","Grill patties indentation side down (uncovered and directly over coals for charcoal; covered for gas), without moving them, until browned and they release easily from grill, about 5 minutes.","Flip burgers and grill (covered for gas) until browned on second side and meat registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), about 5 minutes, or 135 degrees (for medium), about 7 minutes. Transfer burgers to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.","Transfer burgers to buns. Serve."]

notes: "These burgers develop great char and stay perfectly medium-rare (or medium) at the center because we freeze the patties slightly before putting them on the grill. After lighting, it takes about 20 minutes for the charcoal to be ready, so plan the freezing of the patties accordingly. The amount of spice mixture may seem excessive, but it helps form the crust, so be sure to use all of it. These burgers are great topped with our Five-Spice Tomato Chutney, feta cheese, and sliced red onion."
