ingredients: ["12 ounces center-cut, bacon","1/4 cup, packed light brown sugar","1 teaspoon, pepper","1/2 teaspoon, chipotle chile powder","1/2 teaspoon, ground cumin","1/4 teaspoon, granulated garlic"]
serves: 6
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil. Cut bacon in half crosswise. Arrange bacon on prepared sheets.","Combine sugar, pepper, chile powder, cumin, and granulated garlic in bowl. Sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over bacon (do not flip and sprinkle on second side). Use your fingers to spread sugar mixture evenly over each piece.","Bake until bacon is dark brown and sugar is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking (if bacon on 1 sheet finishes cooking sooner, it’s OK to remove this sheet from oven first). Transfer bacon to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "Do not use dark brown sugar here. We call for center-cut bacon because we found the strips to be of more even thickness than regular bacon. The bacon on one baking sheet may cook more quickly; if this happens, it’s OK to remove this sheet from the oven before the other. Lining the sheets with aluminum foil eases cleanup."
