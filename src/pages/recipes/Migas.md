notes: "It’s important to follow the visual cues when making the eggs, as your pan’s thickness will affect the cooking time. If you’re using an electric stove, heat a second burner on low and move the skillet to it when it’s time to adjust the heat. For a spicier dish, use the larger amount of jarred jalapenos."
