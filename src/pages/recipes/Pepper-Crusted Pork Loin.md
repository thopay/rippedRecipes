title: Pepper-Crusted Pork Loin

description: "A spicy, savory crust of crushed peppercorns is the perfect adornment for a relatively bland pork loin, but balancing the two elements isnt as easy as it might seem. Cutting the pepper rub with brown sugar, fresh rosemary, and salt helped to deeply season the meat and temper the pepper burn."
