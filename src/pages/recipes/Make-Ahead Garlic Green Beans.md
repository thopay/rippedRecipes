Cool garlic. Peel and press (or mash) cloves, then, using dinner fork, mash garlic, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in small bowl until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.","When ready to serve, heat beans and 1/4 cup water in large skillet, covered, over high heat, 3 to 4 minutes.
