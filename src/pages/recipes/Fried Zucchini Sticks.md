instructions: ["Quarter zucchini lengthwise. Using vegetable peeler, shave seeds from inner portion of each quarter. Halve each quarter lengthwise, then cut in half crosswise. (You should have 32 pieces total.)","Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, granulated garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 3/4 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne together in large bowl. Reserve 1/2 cup flour mixture. Slowly whisk beer into remaining flour mixture until consistency of pancake batter (you may have leftover beer).","Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 1 1/2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.","Toss half of zucchini in bowl with reserved flour mixture until evenly coated. Set fine-mesh strainer over second bowl of similar size and transfer zucchini and flour mixture to strainer; shake to remove all excess flour mixture from zucchini (catching excess in second bowl).","Transfer zucchini to batter and stir to coat. Using tongs, drop each spear into hot oil and stir quickly to prevent pieces from clumping together. Cook until light golden brown, about 4 minutes. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 350 and 375 degrees.","Transfer spears to prepared wire rack and season with salt. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining zucchini spears, flour mixture, and batter. Serve."]

notes: "Use medium zucchini about 7 inches long. Dredge the zucchini just before frying for the best texture. You may not need the full 3/4 cup of beer to achieve the correct pancake batter–like consistency in step 2. This recipe can easily be doubled."
