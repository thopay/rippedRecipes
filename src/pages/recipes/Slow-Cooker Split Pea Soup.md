notes: "Ham hocks add a deep, meaty flavor to soups and other recipes. Cut from the ankle joint of the hog’s leg, hocks contain a great deal of bone, fat, and connective tissue, which lend complex flavor and a rich, satiny texture to soups. They can most often be found near the ham and bacon in the supermarket."
