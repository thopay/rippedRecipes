Stir in garlic, tomato paste, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.","Stir in corn-bacon mixture, water, and tomatoes and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until liquid has reduced by three-fourths, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in reserved tomato juice and cook until liquid is reduced by two-thirds and mixture is slightly thickened and creamy, about 10 minutes longer.
