instructions: ["Place flour in shallow dish. Beat eggs in second shallow dish. Combine panko, Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¾ teaspoon pepper in third shallow dish.","Cut meat with grain into 4 equal strips. Flip strips onto cut side, cover with plastic wrap, and pound each with meat pounder to even ¼-inch thickness. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.","Working with 1 steak at a time, dredge steaks in flour, shaking off excess; dip in eggs, allowing excess to drip off; and coat with panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet.","Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line rack with triple layer of paper towels. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Carefully place 2 steaks in skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to prepared wire rack. Return oil to just smoking and repeat with remaining 2 steaks.","Discard oil and wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add capers, garlic, and oregano and cook until fragrant and capers are sizzling, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes and caper brine and cook until tomatoes begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons basil and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Serve steak with sauce."]

notes: "Flap meat, which is also sold as steak tips or sirloin tips, can be packaged as whole steaks, cubes, or strips. For this recipe, we prefer to buy a whole 1-pound flap meat steak and butcher it ourselves. If you can’t find flap meat, you can substitute four 4-ounce cube steaks that have been pounded to a ¼-inch thickness. You can substitute vegetable oil for the extra-virgin olive oil, if desired."
