instructions: ["Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Using highest saute function, heat oil in Instant Pot until just smoking. Arrange half of chicken in even layer in pot and cook until well browned on first side, about 5 minutes; transfer to bowl. Repeat with remaining chicken.","Add onions, garlic, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt to fat left in pot and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits, until onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in oregano and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine, scraping up any remaining browned bits, and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1½ cups marinara sauce, broth, and bay leaves.","Add chicken and any accumulated juices to broth mixture, and arrange potatoes on top of chicken, pressing down gently to submerge potatoes completely in broth mixture. Lock lid into place and close pressure-release valve. Select high pressure-cook function and cook for 10 minutes.","Turn off Instant Pot and quick-release pressure. Carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Off heat, gently stir peas and remaining 1½ cups marinara sauce into cooking liquid and let sit, covered, until peas are heated through, about 2 minutes; discard bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle individual portions with Parmesan and drizzle with extra oil. Serve."]

notes: "We prefer chicken thighs in this recipe for their deep flavor and richness. If youd like to substitute chicken breasts, shred the cooked breasts as the peas warm through in step 4 and then return the shredded chicken to the pot before serving. We prefer Raos Homemade Marinara Sauce; you can substitute other brands of marinara, but the texture of the finished stew may vary. Note that only 1½ cups of marinara are added to the pot before cooking; 1½ cups are added after cooking to contribute texture and brightness to the finished stew. For extra richness, top with a dollop of your favorite pesto."
