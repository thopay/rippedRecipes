time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Spread insides of muffins evenly with butter and arrange split side up on rimmed baking sheet. Combine mayonnaise and ketchup in bowl; set aside. Crack 2 eggs into small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining 2 eggs and second small bowl.","Working with wet hands, form sausage into four 4-inch-diameter patties. Cook sausage patties in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until well browned and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes per side; transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Broil muffins until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through broiling. Flip muffins and broil until just crisp on second side, 1 to 2 minutes; set aside while cooking eggs.","Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working quickly, pour 1 bowl of eggs in 1 side of pan and second bowl of eggs in other side. Cover and cook for 1 minute.","Working quickly, top each egg with 1 sausage patty and 1 slice American cheese. Cover pan, remove from heat, and let stand until American cheese is melted and egg whites are cooked through, about 2 minutes.","Spread mayonnaise mixture on muffin bottoms and place 1 sausage-and-cheese-topped egg on each. Divide spinach evenly among sandwiches, then top with tomato slices and muffin tops. Serve."]

notes: "If there’s not enough fat left in the skillet after cooking the sausage in step 2, add enough vegetable oil to measure 1 tablespoon."
