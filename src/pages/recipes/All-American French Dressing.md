notes: "Odds are that you have everything you need in the pantry to make this quick and easy salad dressing. Use the large holes of a box grater to grate the onion, and remember that a little bit of grated onion goes a long way. This dressing is traditionally served with iceberg or other mild lettuces such as green leaf, red leaf, romaine, Boston, or Bibb. We think its sweet-and-sour punch also works well with bitter greens, such as Belgian endive, radicchio, and watercress."
