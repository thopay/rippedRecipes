notes: "“This recipe is a family favorite served when we watch the Pittsburgh Steelers football games with family and friends. When the Steelers win, we’re sure it’s because of the lucky dip.” Pecorino Romano is a hard sheep’s-milk cheese with a strong, tangy flavor. If you cannot find it, Parmesan can be substituted. Toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes."
