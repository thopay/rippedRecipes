instructions: ["Whisk eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl until thoroughly combined and mixture is pure yellow, about 1 minute. Set aside.","Cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet (leaving bacon in skillet). Add onion and jalapeno and cook until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes.","Add egg mixture and, using heat-resistant rubber spatula, constantly and firmly scrape along bottom and sides of skillet until eggs begin to clump and spatula leaves trail on bottom of skillet, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes.","Reduce heat to low. Gently but constantly fold egg mixture until it has clumped and is still slightly wet, 30 to 60 seconds. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Fill tortillas with egg mixture and serve immediately, passing salsa, Monterey Jack, scallions, and lime wedges separately."]

notes: "It’s important to follow visual cues when making the eggs, as your pan’s thickness will affect the cooking time. If you’re using an electric stovetop for the eggs, heat a second burner on low and move the skillet to it when it’s time to adjust the heat. You can substitute store-bought tortillas for the homemade. This recipe makes enough filling for 12 (6-inch) tacos."
