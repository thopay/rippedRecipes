description: "Blueberry streusel muffins are a coffeehouse favorite, but most recipes bake up either dry or spongy with weak blueberry flavor and a tough, sandy topping. We wanted a tender, cakey muffin bursting with berries and crowned with chewy nuggets of butter and sugar."

notes: "To prevent a streaky batter, leave the blueberries in the freezer until the last possible moment. Wymans brand frozen wild blueberries are our first choice, but an equal amount of fresh blueberries may be substituted."
