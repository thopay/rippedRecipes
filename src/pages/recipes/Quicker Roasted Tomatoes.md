serves: 2
time: "1¾ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Quarter tomatoes lengthwise. Working with 1 tomato quarter at a time, position tomatoes seed side up on cutting board. Using paring knife, cut interior pulp and seeds from tomatoes and discard. Transfer tomatoes to large bowl. Add garlic, oil, sugar, salt, oregano, thyme, and pepper flakes and toss to thoroughly combine.","Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange tomatoes, skin side down, in even layer on prepared sheet. Place any garlic that has fallen onto sheet on top of tomatoes.","Bake until tomatoes are shriveled, dry, and dark around edges, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Let cool completely on sheet, about 15 minutes. Serve. (Tomatoes can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. For longer storage, place tomatoes in jar, cover with extra-virgin olive oil, and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.)"]

notes: "This recipe can easily be doubled. To do so, adjust the oven racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions, divide the tomatoes evenly between two parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheets, and rotate and switch the sheets halfway through baking. Plum tomatoes work best for this recipe. Other tomato varieties will work, but they may be slightly softer after roasting."
