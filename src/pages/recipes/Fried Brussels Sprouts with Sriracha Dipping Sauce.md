notes: "Be sure to choose Brussels sprouts that are similar in size to ensure even cooking. For this recipe, we prefer larger Brussels sprouts, about the size of golf balls, because theyre easier to dip in the sauce. To keep the sprouts leaves intact and attached to their cores, trim just a small amount from the stems before cutting the sprouts in half. If you choose to wash your sprouts before cooking, do so before trimming and halving them. Stir gently and not too often in step 2; excessive stirring will cause the leaves to separate from the sprouts."
