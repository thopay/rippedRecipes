ingredients: ["2 3/4 cups (15⅛ ounces), bread flour","1 tablespoon, instant or rapid-rise yeast","1 1/4 teaspoons, table salt","1 cup plus 6 tablespoons (11 ounces) warm, whole milk (110 degrees)","2 tablespoons, honey","5 tablespoons, cornmeal, divided","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces, divided"]
serves: 8
time: "45 minutes, plus 2 hours rising and 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Combine flour, yeast, and salt in large bowl. In second bowl, whisk warm milk and honey together. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and stir until no pockets of dry flour remain. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.","Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with vegetable oil spray. Sprinkle prepared sheet with 4 tablespoons cornmeal. Using greased ¼-cup dry measuring cup, divide dough into 8 heaping ¼-cup portions. Using your lightly greased hands, lightly cup each portion of dough and shape into even 2- to 2½-inch-diameter round about 1 inch tall, then place on prepared sheet. Sprinkle tops of rounds with remaining 1 tablespoon cornmeal. Cover sheet loosely with greased plastic and let rounds rise in warm place until puffy and nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 4 dough rounds and cook until deep golden brown on first side, about 2 minutes, moving rounds as needed for even browning. Flip muffins and cook until deep golden brown on second side, about 2 minutes, pressing down lightly with spatula if muffins begin to rise unevenly. Transfer muffins to clean baking sheet. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels and repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and remaining 4 dough rounds.","Bake muffins until centers register 205 to 210 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes. Let muffins cool completely on wire rack. Using fork, split muffins. Toast and serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: In step 2, let dough rounds rise in refrigerator for at least 12 hours, until nearly doubled in size (you can refrigerate them for up to 48 hours). When ready to bake, proceed with step 3."]

notes: "For the best texture, use a fork to split the muffins. Dont heat the milk higher than 110 degrees; doing so will kill the yeast and result in squat muffins."
