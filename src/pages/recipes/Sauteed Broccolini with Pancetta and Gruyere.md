serves: 4
time: "35 minutes"
instructions: ["Cook pancetta in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until lightly browned and crispy, about 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.","Combine oil, water, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes in now-empty skillet. Add broccolini and toss to coat with oil mixture. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until paring knife inserted in thickest stalks of broccolini meets little resistance, about 5 minutes, shaking skillet occasionally to redistribute broccolini.","Uncover and cook until water has evaporated and broccolini is lightly browned in spots, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking.","Off heat, stir in lemon zest. Season with salt to taste. Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with pancetta and Gruyere. Serve with lemon wedges."]

notes: "Shred the Gruyere on the large holes of a box grater. Buy a hunk of pancetta, not the presliced kind. To serve more than four, make two separate batches rather than just doubling the recipe."
