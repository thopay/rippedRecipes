notes: "We developed this basic farro pilaf recipe using Bob’s Red Mill Organic Farro. You can also use whole-grain or semipearled farro here if you can find it, but note that the cooking time will be on the longer side of the range given. To use whole-grain farro, soak it for at least 8 hours or up to 12 hours and drain it thoroughly before starting with step 1. Do not use quick-cooking farro here."
