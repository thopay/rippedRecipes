Increase speed to medium-high and whip until fluffy, about 1 minute. Transfer to large bowl; set aside.","In now-empty mixer bowl, whip 3/4 cup cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Gently fold whipped cream into peanut butter mixture in 2 additions until no white streaks remain. Spoon filling into crust and spread into even layer.","In now-empty mixer bowl, whip vanilla, remaining cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Spread whipped cream evenly over filling. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Sprinkle with remaining peanuts. Serve."]
