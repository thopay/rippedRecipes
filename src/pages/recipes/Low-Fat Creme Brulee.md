serves: 8
time: "1¼ hours, plus 2 hours cooling and 4 hours chilling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine half-and-half, milk, 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla seeds and pod, and salt in large saucepan. Whisk egg yolks and cornstarch in bowl until combined, then whisk into half-and-half mixture. Bring half-and-half mixture to boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Place chopped white chocolate in large liquid measuring cup and strain half-and-half mixture through fine-mesh strainer on top of chocolate. Whisk until completely smooth.","Bring 2 quarts water to boil. Place kitchen towel in bottom of roasting pan and arrange eight 4- to 5-ounce ramekins (or shallow fluted dishes) on towel. Divide custard mixture evenly among ramekins. Carefully place pan on oven rack and pour boiling water into pan until water comes halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake until custard is just set and center registers 170 degrees, about 30 minutes (about 20 minutes if using shallow fluted dishes).","Carefully transfer ramekins to wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Refrigerate, covered, until cold, at least 4 hours or up to 2 days.","Uncover ramekins; if condensation has collected on surface, blot gently with paper towel. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar evenly over surface of each custard. Caramelize sugar with torch until deep golden brown (see related instructions). Let stand 5 minutes. Serve."]
