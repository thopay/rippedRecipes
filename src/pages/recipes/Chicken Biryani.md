instructions: ["FOR THE GARNISH AND SAUCE: Combine saffron and water in bowl and set aside. Combine yogurt, cilantro, mint, garlic, salt, and pepper in second bowl and set aside.","FOR THE BIRYANI: Set fine-mesh strainer in medium bowl. Melt butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until dark brown, 11 to 14 minutes. Transfer onion to prepared strainer and press with spatula to squeeze out excess butter (reserve butter). Spread onion on small plate and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon salt. Set aside onion and butter (do not wash skillet).","Meanwhile, bring 12 cups water, cinnamon stick, and cumin seeds to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Add rice and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain rice in fine-mesh strainer. Return rice to saucepan and stir in currants, reserved butter, and ¼ teaspoon salt; cover and set aside.","Combine chicken, pepper, and remaining ¾ teaspoon salt in now-empty skillet and cook over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in jalapeno, ginger, garam masala, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in yogurt until combined.","Spoon rice over chicken mixture and spread into even layer. Drizzle saffron mixture evenly over rice, spiraling in from edge of skillet to center. Cover skillet, return to medium heat, and cook until heated through and steam escapes from under lid, about 5 minutes. Off heat, sprinkle biryani with reserved fried onion, mint, and cilantro. Serve with yogurt sauce."]

notes: "To make this dish spicier, reserve and add the jalapeno seeds to the biryani as desired. You can substitute long-grain white rice for the basmati, if you like; it will be less fluffy and will need to cook for about 12 minutes in step 3."
