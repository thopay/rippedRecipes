ingredients: ["6 , jalapeno chiles, halved lengthwise with stems left intact, seeds and ribs removed","¼ teaspoon, table salt","4 ounces, sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)","4 ounces, cream cheese, softened","1 , scallion, sliced thin","1 tablespoon chopped pickled, jalapeno chiles","1 tablespoon, minced fresh cilantro","2 teaspoons, cornstarch","1 teaspoon, grated lime zest","6 slices, bacon, halved crosswise"]
serves: 4
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Arrange jalapeno halves cut side up on cutting board and sprinkle evenly with salt. Stir cheddar, cream cheese, scallion, pickled jalapenos, cilantro, cornstarch, and lime zest in bowl until well combined.","Divide cheese mixture evenly among jalapeno halves (about 1 tablespoon per half), gently pressing filling into cavities so it is flush with cut edges. Wrap each popper with bacon, overlapping ends of bacon pieces underneath jalapeno halves. (Bacon-wrapped poppers can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours; arrange on large plate and cover with plastic wrap until ready to cook.)","Arrange poppers in even layer in air-fryer basket. Place basket in air fryer and set temperature to 400 degrees. Cook until jalapenos are tender and bacon is golden and crisp, 10 to 14 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "Look for large jalapenos that are about 4 inches long and 1¼ inches thick at the stem end. If your jalapenos are smaller, do not overfill them; the filling should be level with the cut sides. This recipe can easily be doubled. If doubling, cook the poppers in two batches. This recipe was developed using a basket-style air fryer, but you can cook the poppers in an oven-style air fryer. Some air-fryer models have preheating functions; the cook-time range in this recipe is intended to work with either a cold or preheated air fryer."
