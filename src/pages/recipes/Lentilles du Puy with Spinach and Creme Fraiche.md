notes: "You can substitute other French green lentils for the lentilles du Puy, but do not substitute other types of green lentils or black, brown, or red lentils—the cooking times of the other lentil varieties can vary greatly. By the end of step 2, the lentils should have absorbed most, but not all, of the chicken broth. If the bottom of the saucepan looks dry and the lentils are still somewhat firm, add hot water, ¼ cup at a time, and continue to cook until the lentils are tender. For a vegetarian version, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth. If you cant find creme fraiche, sour cream works well."
