instructions: ["Combine eggplant, zucchini, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add vegetable mixture (skillet will be full); cover; and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggplant has released its moisture, 14 to 16 minutes.","Uncover and add oregano and pepper flakes. Continue to cook, uncovered, stirring often, until eggplant is mostly broken down, about 10 minutes longer. Stir in tomatoes and cook until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.","Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot.","Add ¼ cup basil, olives, capers, eggplant mixture, and ½ cup reserved cooking water to pasta and toss to combine.

notes: "Avoid overly large eggplants and choose ones that are firm and seem heavy for their size; they should have glossy, vibrant skin without blemishes, bruises, or indentations. We like how the curved edges of mafaldine catch the sauce here, but you can substitute 1 pound of spaghetti or linguine."
