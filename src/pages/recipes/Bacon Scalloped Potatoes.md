instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate and pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat. Cook onion in bacon fat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, salt, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in potatoes, half-and-half, and baking soda and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are almost tender, about 15 minutes.","Off heat, stir in cheese, cooked bacon, and parsley and transfer mixture to 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Bake until sauce is bubbling around edges and top is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.","Make Ahead: After the potato mixture has been transferred to a baking dish in step 2, the dish can be wrapped in foil and refrigerated for 24 hours. When ready to serve, bake until bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until top is golden brown, about 15 minutes."]
