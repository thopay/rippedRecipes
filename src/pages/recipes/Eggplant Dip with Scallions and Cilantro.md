serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Poke each eggplant about 6 times with paring knife.","FOR THE OVEN: Adjust oven rack 8 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high.","Place eggplants on prepared sheet (or directly on cooking grate) and broil (or grill, covered) for 20 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and flip eggplants (or flip eggplants on grill). Return sheet to oven and broil (or grill, covered) for 10 minutes. (Skin should be charred and have aroma of burning leaves.) Transfer eggplants to plate and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.","Meanwhile, combine lemon juice, garlic, and salt in medium bowl and let sit while eggplants cool.","Working with 1 eggplant at a time, split lengthwise on 1 side through skin and peel back skin to expose flesh. Using spoon, scoop out eggplant flesh; discard eggplant skin. Chop eggplant flesh fine with chef's knife and transfer to bowl with lemon juice mixture.","Add tahini, 2 tablespoons oil, scallions, cilantro, cumin, and pepper flakes to eggplant mixture and whisk to combine. Let dip sit for 20 minutes to allow flavors to blend, stirring occasionally. Season with extra lemon juice, salt, cumin, and pepper flakes to taste. Spread dip in shallow bowl and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Serve."]

notes: "We took inspiration from worldwide iterations of baba ghanoush to create our own version of an eggplant dip. If the only eggplants you can find weigh more than 12 ounces, you may need to go a little heavier on the salt, lemon juice, cumin, and pepper flakes when seasoning to taste in step 6. The finished product should be assertive but not overpowering."
