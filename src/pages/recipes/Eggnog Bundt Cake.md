Spray 12-cup nonstick Bundt pan with baking spray with flour.","Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in bowl. Whisk buttermilk, vanilla, and lemon juice together in small bowl.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs and yolk, one at a time, and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk mixture in 2 additions, scraping down bowl as needed. Give batter final stir by hand.","Combine 1 cup cake batter, 1 tablespoon rum, nutmeg, and cinnamon in large bowl and stir until just combined. Using rubber spatula, spread remaining batter in prepared pan and smooth top. Spoon spiced batter over top and spread gently in thin, even layer. Bake until skewer inserted in center comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 50 minutes to 1 hour, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 25 minutes. Invert cake onto wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, remove pan, and let cool completely on rack, about 3 hours.","Whisk confectioners' sugar and remaining 3 tablespoons rum in bowl until smooth. Drizzle glaze over cooled cake and let set for 25 minutes before serving."]
