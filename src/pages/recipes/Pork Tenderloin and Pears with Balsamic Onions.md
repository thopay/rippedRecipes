Transfer pears to plate with pork.","Add onions and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt to now-empty skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until softened and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.","Off heat, stir in vinegar and sugar, scraping up any browned bits. Arrange pork and pears in even layer over onion mixture in skillet. Transfer skillet to oven and roast until pork registers 135 to 140 degrees, 10 to 12 minutes.","Transfer pork to carving board and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice pork crosswise ½ inch thick. Arrange pork and pears on serving platter.","Stir any accumulated pork juices from carving board into onions and heat over medium-low heat until just simmering (skillet handle will be hot).
