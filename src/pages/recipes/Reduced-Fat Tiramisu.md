notes: "Be sure to use the crisp, firm ladyfingers found in the cookie or international aisle, not the fresh, cakelike ladyfingers found in the bakery department. Depending on the brand, 5 ounces is about 25 to 30 ladyfingers. You can substitute ¾ cup of strong brewed coffee for the hot water and espresso powder."
