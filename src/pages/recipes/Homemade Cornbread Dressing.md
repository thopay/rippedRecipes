instructions: ["PREPARE CORNBREAD Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease and flour 13- by 9-inch baking pan. Whisk milk, oil, and eggs in bowl; set aside. Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in large bowl. Add milk mixture, whisking until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake on lower-middle rack until golden and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan on wire rack, about 2 hours. (Cornbread can be prepared up to 2 days in advance.)","DRY CORNBREAD Heat oven to 250 degrees. Cut cornbread into 1-inch squares. Divide cornbread between two rimmed baking sheets and bake until dry, 50 to 60 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Cool cornbread completely on sheets, about 30 minutes.","SAUTE AROMATICS Cook sausage in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to paper towel-lined plate and pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan. Add onions, celery, and 2 tablespoons butter to fat in pan and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, sage, and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth, remove from heat, and let cool 5 minutes.","SOAK CORNBREAD Whisk half-and-half, eggs, salt, and cayenne in large bowl. Slowly whisk in warm broth mixture until incorporated. Fold in dried cornbread and reserved sausage and let sit, tossing occasionally, until saturated, about 20 minutes.","BAKE DRESSING Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 13- by 9-inch baking pan. Transfer soaked cornbread to prepared pan. Melt remaining butter and drizzle evenly over top. Bake on upper-middle rack until surface is golden brown and crisp, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes.

notes: "The baked cornbread can be left in its pan up to two days before making the stuffing. Instead of oven-drying in step 2, stale the cubed cornbread overnight at room temperature. Use fine or coarse cornmeal."
