Transfer mixture to large bowl and beat in egg. Stir in flour mixture until just combined.","BAKE COOKIES Place 1-tablespoon scoops of dough 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake cookies until puffed and edges are set but centers are slightly soft, 8 to 10 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Cool 5 minutes on sheets, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.","MAKE FILLING Whisk remaining butter, milk, and peppermint extract in medium bowl until combined. Add confectioners' sugar and mix until smooth.
