Carefully and slowly whisk milk (mixture may bubble), pepper, and salt into remaining browned butter in saucepan. Cover to keep warm.","Drain potatoes and return to now-empty large saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are thoroughly dried and begin to break apart, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.","Using potato masher, mash potatoes in saucepan until smooth and no lumps remain.","Whisk browned butter–milk mixture into potatoes until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving bowl. Drizzle with reserved 2 tablespoons browned butter. Serve."]
