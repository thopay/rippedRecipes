instructions: ["FOR THE MEATBALLS: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Set wire rack in aluminum foil—lined rimmed baking sheet.","Place saltines in large zipper-lock bag, seal bag, and crush fine with rolling pin (you should end up with 1 scant cup crushed saltines). Combine saltines and milk in large bowl, mashing with rubber spatula until paste forms, about 1 minute.","Add chopped mint, scallions, oregano, garlic, lemon zest, cumin, coriander, pepper, and salt to saltine mixture and mash until thoroughly combined. Add lamb and mix with your hands until thoroughly combined.","Divide mixture into 40 portions (1 heaping tablespoon each). Roll portions between your wet hands to form 1½-inch meatballs and evenly space on prepared wire rack. Roast until meatballs are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.","FOR THE SAUCE: While meatballs roast, whisk all ingredients together in bowl; set aside.","Using tongs, transfer meatballs to serving platter. Serve with sauce and sprinkle with mint leaves.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Uncooked meatballs can be frozen for up to 2 months. After shaping meatballs in step 4, transfer to greased plate and freeze until completely frozen, at least 2 hours. Transfer frozen meatballs to 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag. To serve, cook from frozen and increase roasting time to 25 minutes."]
