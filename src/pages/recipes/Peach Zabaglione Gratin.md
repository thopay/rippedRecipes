notes: "For the best results, use in-season, ripe peaches here. A ripe peach will be fragrant and yield slightly when pressed with your thumb. We like to use freestone peaches, if theyre available, because theyre easier to prepare. Dont use cooking Marsala in this recipe—use a drinking-quality Marsala instead. Other sweet wines such as moscato and port can be substituted for the Marsala, if desired. Note that depending on the type of bowl you use, the timing of the zabaglione will vary by several minutes. The finished zabaglione should have the texture of soft whipped cream."
