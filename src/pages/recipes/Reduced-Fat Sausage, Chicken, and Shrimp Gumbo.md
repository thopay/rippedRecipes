time: "1¾ hours"
instructions: ["Toast flour in Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring constantly, until light brown and fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl.","Heat oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium heat until just smoking. Add sausage and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in toasted flour, garlic, thyme, and cayenne and cook until ­fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in broth slowly to avoid lumps. Stir in tomatoes and fish sauce. Add chicken and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken registers 160 degrees, about 25 minutes.","Transfer chicken to plate. Cover gumbo and remove from heat. When chicken is cool enough to handle, shred into bite-size pieces and return to pot; discard bones. Return gumbo to simmer, stir in shrimp and okra, and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve. (Gumbo can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)"]

notes: "The toasted flour in step 1 should be slightly paler than a brown paper bag. You can find fish sauce in the international food aisle of most grocery stores. Since the salt content of fish sauce varies from brand to brand, taste the finished gumbo before seasoning it with salt. Serve with rice."
