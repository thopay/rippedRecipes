serves: 4
time: "2½ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Prick each potato lightly with fork in 6 places. Dissolve 1 tablespoon salt in ½ cup water in large bowl. Add potatoes and toss so exteriors are evenly moistened. Place potatoes on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until centers register 205 degrees, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let potatoes cool for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees.","While potatoes bake, cook chorizo in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium heat, breaking up meat with spoon, until well-browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer chorizo to paper towel–lined plate; set aside. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.","With potatoes sitting on flat sides, cut off top ¼ inch and discard. Using fork, carefully remove potato flesh from remaining portion of potato by poking and twisting at insides to loosen, leaving ¼-inch wall all around inside of potato. Transfer potato flesh to medium bowl. Set aside potato shells.","Using potato masher, mash potato flesh until smooth. Stir in 3 tablespoons melted butter, sour cream, chipotle, and salt until incorporated. Stir in Monterey Jack, scallions, and chorizo until combined. Season with salt to taste.","Divide filling among potato shells (scant ¾ cup each), mounding filling over tops of potatoes. Fluff up top of filling with tines of fork. Brush 1 tablespoon melted butter in now-empty skillet and place potatoes in skillet. Brush remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter over tops of potatoes.","Bake until potatoes are warmed through and beginning to brown on top, 20 to 23 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving."]

notes: "Try to find potatoes of equal size and weight to ensure even cooking. Larger potatoes will work, but the baking time in step 1 will be longer. This recipe can easily be doubled."
