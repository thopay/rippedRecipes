Place guajillos in 12-inch nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.","Transfer guajillos to blender jar and process until finely ground, about 2 minutes.

notes: "One ounce of guajillo chiles is about four chiles. New Mexican chiles can be substituted for the guajillos. We prefer untreated shrimp—those not treated with sodium or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate. Most frozen E-Z peel shrimp have been treated (check the ingredient list). If youre using treated shrimp, omit the ½ teaspoon of salt for seasoning the shrimp in step 3. Serve with warm tortillas or rice."
