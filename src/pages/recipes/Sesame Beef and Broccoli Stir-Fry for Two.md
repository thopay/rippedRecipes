serves: 2
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Combine beef, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in bowl; let sit for 10 minutes. Combine scallion whites, 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes in second bowl. Whisk orange juice, sesame oil, cornstarch, remaining 5 teaspoons soy sauce, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar together in third bowl.","Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add beef in single layer, breaking up any clumps, and cook without stirring for 1 minute. Stir and continue to cook until beef is browned all over, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer beef to clean bowl.","Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil to now-empty skillet and return to medium-high heat. Add broccoli and water and cook, covered, until nearly tender, about 2 minutes. Push broccoli to sides of skillet. Add scallion mixture to center and cook, mashing mixture into skillet, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

notes: "Freezing the beef for 15 minutes makes it easier to slice thin. After trimming the steak, you should have about 8 ounces of sliced meat. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of grating the ginger. Toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium-low heat, stirring often, until lightly browned and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with rice."
