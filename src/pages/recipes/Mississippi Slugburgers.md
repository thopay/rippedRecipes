Working on baking sheet, flatten each ball into 4½-inch-diameter patty, about ½ inch thick. (Patties can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 hours.)","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees (to take temperature, tilt skillet so oil pools on 1 side). Carefully add patties to hot oil and cook until well browned on both sides and registering at least 150 degrees, about 4 minutes per side.

notes: "Note that we are calling for corn flour, not cornmeal, here. Cornmeal is much coarser than corn flour and will not work in this recipe. Although theyre sometimes harder to find, soy and sorghum flours also work in this recipe. All-purpose flour will work in a pinch but is not ideal. This recipe can easily be doubled and cooked in two batches. A scale makes quick work of portioning the burgers. Yellow mustard has a magical way with these burgers. While the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon per burger, feel free to use it more liberally."
