Remove from heat and whisk in gelatin mixture until all lumps dissolve. Whisk in rum, if using.

Using large spatula, gently fold pineapple-coconut mixture into whipped cream. Scrape mousse into 1-quart ring mold. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until completely set, at least 6 hours or up to 1 day.","Unmold: Dip ring mold in hot water for 30 seconds.

notes: "If you like pina coladas... youll love this frozen mousse made from pineapple juice and cream of coconut; add the optional rum, and its perfect for grown-up gatherings. Fill the center with a blend of fresh pineapple, oranges, limes, and strawberries, or,  for a more elegant presentation, use raspberries all by themselves."
