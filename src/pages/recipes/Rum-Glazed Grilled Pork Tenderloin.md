serves: 4
time: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["Simmer sugar, jelly, rum, vinegar, molasses, and pepper flakes in saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in mustard and cilantro; cover and keep warm.","Season tenderloins with salt and pepper and grill over hot fire until browned on all sides and meat registers 140 degrees, about 12 minutes. Brush with half of rum glaze and cook 1 minute longer. Transfer to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes. Slice pork and serve, passing remaining glaze at table."]
nutrition: undefined
notes: "While light, golden, and even spiced rums can be used, we prefer the deep, earthy flavor of dark rum in this recipe. Avoid blackstrap molassesâ€”it will make the glaze unpalatably bitter."
