instructions: ["Whisk flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk brown sugar, melted butter, molasses, and ginger together in large bowl until combined. Whisk in egg and buttermilk until combined. Add flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until dough just comes together. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 scant tablespoon dough at a time, roll into 1-inch balls and space them evenly on prepared sheets, about 24 per sheet. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until cookies have puffed and are just set, 11 to 13 minutes. Let cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat confectioners’ sugar and remaining 6 tablespoons butter on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. With mixer running, add cream cheese, 1 piece at a time, and continue to beat until smooth, about 30 seconds. If frosting is very soft, refrigerate for 15 minutes before filling cookies. Spread or pipe 1 tablespoon frosting onto bottoms of half of cookies; sandwich frosting with remaining cookies, bottom side down, pressing gently to adhere. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve."]
