instructions: ["FOR THE STEW: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Sprinkle pork with ¾ teaspoon salt, ¾ teaspoon pepper, and cayenne. Toss pork with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.","Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to plate.","Add pork in single layer to fat left in pot, breaking up any clumps. Cook, without stirring, until well browned on bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to plate with bacon.","Add cabbage, onion, carrots, garlic, rosemary, remaining ½ teaspoon salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper to fat left in pot (if very little fat remains, add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil). Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is wilted, 5 to 7 minutes.","Stir in remaining ¼ cup flour to coat vegetables. Slowly stir in broth and mustard, scraping up any browned bits and smoothing out any lumps with wooden spoon. Bring to simmer. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low; and simmer until flavors meld, about 7 minutes. Off heat, stir in pork, bacon, and any accumulated juices.","FOR THE DUMPLINGS: Meanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Stir in ¾ cup cheddar. Add cream and stir until just combined.","Using 2 large soupspoons, drop golf ball–size portions of dumpling dough onto stew (about 14 dumplings). Sprinkle dumplings with remaining ¼ cup cheddar. Bake, uncovered, until tops of dumplings are light golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve."]
