instructions: ["Bring 12 cups water to boil in large saucepan over high heat.

Transfer eggs to ice bath and let cool for 5 minutes.","To peel, gently tap 1 egg on counter to crack shell all over. Begin peeling off shell at wider end of egg, making sure to break membrane between shell and egg white. Under gently running water, carefully peel membrane and shell off egg.

notes: "Start timing after adding the last egg to the boiling water. This recipe works equally well with as few as two eggs; however, the timing changes when more than eight eggs are cooked at once."
