instructions: ["FOR THE MEATBALLS: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with vegetable oil spray. Microwave mushrooms in covered bowl until liquid is released, about 5 minutes. Strain mushrooms through colander, transfer to food processor, and process until finely ground, about 30 seconds. Return mushrooms to now-empty bowl; set aside. Add bread and broth to now-empty processor and process until paste forms, about 30 seconds. Transfer bread mixture to large bowl; set aside.","Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add onion and mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned bits form on bottom of pot, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and oregano and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add to bowl with bread mixture. Add beef, parsley, egg white, soy sauce, salt, and pepper and knead with your hands until combined. Using ¼-cup dry measuring cup, divide mixture into 12 portions, shape into meatballs, and place on prepared sheet. Bake until well browned, about 15 minutes.","FOR THE MARINARA: Meanwhile, heat oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and salt and cook until beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato paste, garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook until rust-colored and fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes and broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover with lid slightly ajar, and simmer until sauce is no longer watery, 20 to 30 minutes.","Add meatballs to sauce and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Stir Parmesan and basil into sauce. Serve. (Meatballs and sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)"]
