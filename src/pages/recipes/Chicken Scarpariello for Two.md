Add bell pepper and onion and cook until vegetables are softened and charred in spots, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Add cherry peppers, garlic, flour, and oregano and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in broth, sausage, and cherry pepper brine and bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits.","Nestle chicken, skin side up, into sauce and pour in any accumulated juices.

notes: "We call for sweet Italian sausage here to balance the spiciness of the cherry peppers. Feel free to substitute hot Italian sausage if you prefer a spicier dish. Serve with crusty bread."
