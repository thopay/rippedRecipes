instructions: ["FOR THE INFUSED BOURBON AND SYRUP: Combine bourbon and minced mint in bowl and let sit for 15 minutes. Using brush, paint both sides of remaining mint leaves with thin coat of egg white. Gently press both sides of each leaf into granulated sugar. Shake off excess sugar and place leaves on paper towel–lined plate to dry. Bring brown sugar and water to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar; set aside.","FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour 12-cup nonstick tube pan. Strain bourbon-mint mixture through fine-mesh strainer into bowl, pressing on mint to release as much liquid as possible; reserve mint. Add strained mint and 1/4 cup infused bourbon to cake batter and stir to combine. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour, rotating pan halfway through baking. Cool cake in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert cake onto wire rack. Add 2 tablespoons infused bourbon to brown sugar syrup; brush syrup over top and sides of cake. Let cake cool completely, about 2 hours.","FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk confectioners’ sugar, melted butter, food coloring, and remaining 2 tablespoons infused bourbon together in small bowl until smooth. Pour glaze over cake and let sit for at least 10 minutes to set. Garnish cake with sugared mint leaves and serve."]
