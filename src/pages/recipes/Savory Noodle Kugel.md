instructions: ["Adjust 1 oven rack to middle position and second rack 6 inches from broiler element. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease broiler-safe 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Heat rendered chicken fat (schmaltz) in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 30 to 40 minutes. (Caramelized onions can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)","Transfer onions to large bowl and let cool for 10 minutes. Whisk eggs, parsley, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper into onions; set aside.","Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add noodles and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 3 tablespoons cooking water, then drain noodles and let cool for 5 minutes. Whisk reserved cooking water into onion mixture. Stir still-warm noodles into onion mixture until well combined.","Transfer noodle mixture to prepared dish. Bake on middle oven rack until set, about 20 minutes. Remove kugel from oven and heat broiler. Once broiler is hot, broil kugel on upper rack until top noodles are browned and crisp, 1 to 3 minutes, rotating dish as needed for even browning. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Kugel can be fully assembled, covered, and refrigerated up to 24 hours in advance. Extend baking time to 25 minutes."]

notes: "It’s important to combine the egg mixture with warm noodles. Use a broiler-safe dish for this recipe. Look for rendered chicken fat (schmaltz) in the frozen food section of larger supermarkets. Pennsylvania Dutch Wide Egg Noodles are the test kitchen’s taste test winner."
