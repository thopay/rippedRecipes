serves: 2
time: "25 minutes"
instructions: ["Spray 10-inch nonstick skillet liberally with vegetable oil spray. Add onion, green and red bell pepper, salt, and pepper and cook over medium heat until vegetables are just softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. While vegetables are cooking, process eggs and whites and hot sauce in blender until pale and foamy, about 1 minute.","Add ham and garlic to vegetables in skillet and cook until fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Pour egg mixture into skillet, stir to distribute vegetables, and cook until edges of omelet begin to set, 10 to 20 seconds. Pull cooked edges of omelet into center of skillet using rubber spatula, then tilt skillet to allow uncooked egg mixture to run to edge of pan. Repeat until omelet is just set but still moist on surface, 1 to 2 minutes.","Off heat, sprinkle Monterey Jack and parsley evenly over omelet, cover, and set aside until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Run spatula around edges of omelet to loosen, shaking skillet gently to release. Using spatula, fold omelet in half, then cut in half crosswise. Serve immediately."]
