description: "This bake-sale favorite combines oatmeal cookie dough with a bag of butterscotch chips. We found these versions far too sweet, and we wanted a chewier, less crumbly texture."

instructions: ["FOR THE BARS: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil.","Whisk flour, oats, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Place butterscotch chips in large bowl. Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Continue to cook, swirling skillet constantly, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 5 minutes. Add browned butter to butterscotch chips and whisk until smooth. Whisk in sugar until dissolved, then whisk in vanilla and egg until combined. Stir in flour mixture in 2 additions until combined.","Transfer mixture to prepared pan and spread into even layer. Bake until edges are golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few crumbs attached, 17 to 19 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer pan to wire rack.","FOR THE GLAZE: Place butterscotch chips in small bowl. Bring sugar, water, and salt to simmer in small saucepan. Pour hot sugar mixture over butterscotch chips and whisk until smooth. Drizzle glaze over warm bars and let cool until warm to touch, about 1½ hours.","Using foil overhang, lift bars from pan and transfer to wire rack; let cool completely. Cut into 36 pieces before serving."]

notes: "Quick oats will work in this recipe, but the&nbsp;bars&nbsp;will be less chewy and flavorful; do not use instant oats."
