notes: "We prefer the color and texture of Lacinato kale in this stew, but you can substitute curly kale or 6 ounces of bagged, chopped kale. We top the stew with a cartouche (an oval piece of parchment paper that sits directly on the food) during cooking to trap moisture and help the beans cook evenly."
