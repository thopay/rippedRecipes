Repeat with remaining 2 eggs and second small bowl.","Cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, 7 to 9 minutes; transfer to paper towel–lined plate. When cool enough to handle, break each slice in half.","Broil muffins until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through broiling. Flip muffins and broil until just crisp on second side, 1 to 2 minutes; set aside while cooking eggs.","Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working quickly, pour 1 bowl of eggs in 1 side of pan and second bowl of eggs in other side. Cover and cook for 1 minute.","Working quickly, top each egg with 3 pieces of bacon and ¼ cup cheddar. Cover pan, remove from heat, and let stand until cheddar is melted and egg whites are cooked through, about 2 minutes.","Spread mayonnaise mixture on muffin bottoms and place 1 bacon and-cheese-topped egg on each. Divide spinach evenly among sandwiches, then top with tomato slices and muffin tops. Serve."]
