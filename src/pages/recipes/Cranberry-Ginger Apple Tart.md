ingredients: ["1½ cups (7½ ounces), all-purpose flour","½ teaspoon, table salt","10 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces and chilled","6 tablespoons, ice water","2 pounds Gala or Fuji, apples, peeled, cored, and sliced 1⁄4 inch thick","4 ounces (1 cup), frozen cranberries, thawed","½ cup (3½ ounces), granulated sugar","3 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized, ginger, divided","½ teaspoon, grated orange zest","¼ teaspoon, ground cinnamon","1⁄4 teaspoon, table salt","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces","1 tablespoon, turbinado sugar","2 tablespoons, apple jelly"]
serves: 8
time: "1¾ hours, plus 3 hours chilling and cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE DOUGH: Process flour and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles uniformly coarse crumbs, 10 to 12 pulses. With processor running, add ice water and process until almost no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl after 5 seconds.","Transfer dough to sheet of plastic wrap. Form dough into 5 by 6-inch rectangle, wrap tightly in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. (Wrapped dough can be frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, let dough thaw completely on counter before rolling.)","Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Let chilled dough sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes, before rolling. Roll dough into 16 by 12-inch rectangle on well-floured counter. Starting at short side of dough rectangle, loosely roll dough around rolling pin, then gently unroll over prepared sheet. Cover dough with plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.","FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Just before baking, toss apples, cranberries, granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons crystallized ginger, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt together in bowl.","Transfer filling to center of dough and gently spread into even layer, leaving 2-inch border. Dot filling with butter. Fold overhanging dough over filling, pinching edges to seal and form pointed corners.","Using pastry brush, brush top of dough with water and sprinkle evenly with turbinado sugar. Bake until crust is golden brown and apples are tender, 45 to 55 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let tart cool on sheet on wire rack until filling has set, about 1½ hours.","Microwave jelly in small bowl until fluid, about 30 seconds. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon crystallized ginger. Gently brush mixture over fruit, avoiding crust. Use parchment to transfer tart to cutting board. Cut tart in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into individual portions. Serve."]

notes: "The dough may be slightly sticky in the food processor; do not add any additional flour. The dough will firm up after its rest in the fridge. We like the crunch that turbinado sugar adds to the crust, but granulated sugar can be substituted. The crust will be most crisp on the day the tart is made. Serve the tart with vanilla ice cream or Ginger Whipped Cream and garnish with Sugared Cranberries, if desired. You can substitute apricot preserves for the apple jelly; strain the apricot preserves after heating them."
