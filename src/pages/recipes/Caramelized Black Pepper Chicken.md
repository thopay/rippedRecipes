notes: "This recipe is inspired by Charles Phans recipe from his cookbook The Slanted Door: Modern Vietnamese Food (2014). The saltiness of fish sauce can vary; we recommend Red Boat 40°N Fish Sauce. This dish is intensely seasoned, so serve it with plenty of steamed white rice, preferably jasmine."
