notes: "We recommend serving this dish over polenta. You can substitute eight 5- to 7-ounce bone-in chicken thighs for the leg quarters, if desired. Good-quality olive oil makes a difference here. The anchovies add a background savory richness without tasting like fish; we encourage even nonfans to give them a try here. Be sure to remove the stems from the pepperoncini before mincing them. You can substitute Parmesan for the Pecorino Romano, if desired."
