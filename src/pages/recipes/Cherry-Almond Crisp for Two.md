instructions: ["FOR THE TOPPING: Combine flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in bowl. Stir in melted butter until mixture resembles wet sand and no dry flour remains.","Toast almonds in 8-inch skillet over medium-low heat until just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add flour mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes; transfer to plate to cool. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.","FOR THE FILLING: Combine 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar and cornstarch in small bowl; set aside. Combine sweet cherries, water, lemon juice, vanilla, almond extract, salt, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in now-empty skillet. Cook, covered, over medium heat until cherries thaw and release their juice and mixture starts to simmer, about 5 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking. Stir in dried cherries and simmer, uncovered, until plumped and tender, about 2 minutes.","Stir in cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened, about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle topping evenly over filling. Return skillet to medium-low heat and cook until filling is bubbling around edges, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool for at least 15 minutes. Serve warm."]
