Combine cottage cheese, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon oil in separate bowl; set aside.","Press and roll dough into 15 by 11-inch rectangle on lightly floured counter, pulling on corners to help make distinct rectangle.

Crack 1 egg into each well, then season each with salt and pepper.","Return pizza to oven and bake until crust is light golden around edges and eggs are just set, 9 to 10 minutes for slightly runny yolks or 11 to 12 minutes for soft-cooked yolks, rotating sheet halfway through baking.","Transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes.

notes: "Small-curd cottage cheese is sometimes labeled “country-style.” Room-temperature dough is much easier to shape than cold, so pull the dough from the fridge about 1 hour before you start cooking."
