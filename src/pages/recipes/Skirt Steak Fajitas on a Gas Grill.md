title: Skirt Steak Fajitas on a Gas Grill
author: America's Test Kitchen
pubDate: 2023-03-15
description: "The success of good fajitas is partly due to the rich beefy flavor of skirt steak, but it can be tough if not handled properly. High-heat grilling and a double marinade for the steak are what give our fajitas their bright, bold flavor."

time: ""
instructions: ["Whisk lime juice, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, soy sauce, cumin, brown sugar, and chilein bowl. Transfer 1/4 cup marinade to bowl, add cilantro, and set aside. Prick steaks with fork about 50 times on each side, then cut each steak in half crosswise. Place steaks in large zipper-lock plastic bag, pour in marinade without cilantro, seal bag, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. Remove steaks from bag, pat dry with paper towels, and discard marinade in bag.","Heat all burners on high for 15 minutes. Scrape cooking grate clean.","Meanwhile, brush onions and peppers with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Grill onions and peppers, turning occasionally but keeping lid down, until charred and softened, 8 to 12 minutes (peppers will cook more quickly). Turn off one burner, then move vegetables to cool side of grill. Grill steak directly over hot side of the grill until seared on both sides but still pink in center, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer steak and vegetables to serving platter, pour cilantro marinade over, cover with foil, and let rest 5 minutes.","Meanwhile, toast tortillas over hot side of the grill, about 10 seconds per side. Wrap in aluminum foil to keep warm. Slice steak as shown in photo, and cut vegetables into finger-length pieces. Serve immediately with warm tortillas."]

notes: "Toast the cumin in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute), then remove the pan from the heat so the cumin wont scorch. Serve the fajitas as is or with salsa, shredded cheese, and/or sour cream."
