serves: 6
time: "2½ hours, plus 30 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Position steak on cutting board so long edge is parallel to counter edge. Cover with plastic wrap and pound to even 1/2-inch thickness. Trim any ragged edges to create rough rectangle about 11 by 9 inches. Pat steak dry with paper towels.","Combine garlic and oil in bowl and microwave until fragrant, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly, then remove garlic from oil with fork. Separately reserve garlic and garlic oil. Combine raisins, Parmesan, 1/4 cup basil, parsley, half of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes in bowl.","Brush exposed side of steak with 1 tablespoon garlic oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread raisin mixture evenly over steak, pressing to adhere, leaving 1-inch border along top edge. Starting from bottom edge and rolling away from you, roll steak into tight log, finally resting seam side down. Tie kitchen twine around braciole at 1-inch intervals.","Heat 1 tablespoon garlic oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add braciole, seam side down, and cook until lightly browned all over, about 5 minutes. Transfer to 13 by 9-inch baking dish.","Reduce heat to medium and add onion, remaining garlic oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes to now empty skillet. Cook until onion just begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and remaining half of garlic and cook until fragrant and tomato paste is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, bring to simmer, and pour sauce over braciole. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until fork slips easily in and out of braciole, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. Transfer baking dish to wire rack, spoon sauce over braciole, re-cover, and let rest in sauce for 30 minutes.","Transfer braciole to carving board, seam side down; cut and discard twine; and cut into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Stir remaining 1/4 cup basil into sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle 2 cups sauce onto serving platter. Transfer braciole slices to platter. Serve, passing remaining sauce and extra Parmesan separately.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Follow recipe through step 5, letting braciole cool completely in sauce. Refrigerate braciole and sauce separately. To serve, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring sauce to simmer over medium heat in large saucepan. Stir remaining 1/4 cup basil into sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer braciole to carving board, seam side down; discard twine; and cut into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Pour 2 cups sauce into 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Arrange braciole slices on top of sauce, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until meat is heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately."]

notes: "Look for flank steak of even thickness, without tapered ends. Braciole is usually served with pasta, sometimes together and sometimes separately, as when a pasta course with the sauce is followed by the meat. Our recipe makes enough sauce for at least 1 pound of pasta."
