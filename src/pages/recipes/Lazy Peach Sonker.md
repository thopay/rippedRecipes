notes: "If you’re using frozen peaches in this recipe, there’s no need to let them thaw, but be sure to break up any peach slices that are frozen together. In steps 2 and 3, be sure to stir the peach filling as directed, scraping the bottom of the dish to incorporate the cornstarch so that it evenly and thoroughly thickens the mixture. In step 3, add the butter to the batter while it is still hot so it remains pourable, and be sure to mix the batter only right before pouring it over the filling. Serve with vanilla ice cream."
