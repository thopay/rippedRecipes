description: "Stuffing chicken breasts and grilling them over a smoky fire sounds like a great way to dress up this mild cut, but only if the meat stays juicy and the filling packs a flavorful punch."

Pulse 2 tablespoons oil mixture, basil, cheese, and bread crumbs in food processor until coarsely ground.","Cut pocket in thick part of each chicken breast, spoon in filling, and secure with toothpick.

Scrape and oil cooking grate.","Arrange chicken, smooth-side down, on cooler side of grill with thicker side facing hot side of grill. Cook, covered, until chicken is beginning to brown and meat registers 140 degrees, 16 to 20 minutes, flipping and rotating breasts halfway through cooking time.

notes: "You will need 4 sturdy, uncolored toothpicks for this recipe. We prefer the taste and texture of homemade bread crumbs (simply tear 1 slice of white sandwich bread into pieces, grind in a food processor, and toast in a dry skillet until golden), but store-bought bread crumbs are acceptable here."
