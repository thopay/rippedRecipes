instructions: ["Cut dark green leaves from bok choy stalks. Chop leaves coarse. Place leaves in large bowl and cover with water; swish around to remove sand. Remove leaves from water, transfer to salad spinner, and spin dry; transfer leaves to clean bowl and set aside.","Cut off bottom ¼ inch of bok choy base and discard. Pull bok choy stalks downward to snap off at base until you reach core; discard core. Repeat washing and spinning with stalks. Pat stalks dry with paper towels if still wet.","Combine scallion, honey, and orange zest in small bowl. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add stalks, sprinkle with salt, and cook, without stirring, until beginning to brown on bottom, about 5 minutes. Stir and continue to cook until stalks are just tender, about 1 minute longer.","Add leaves and scallion mixture and cook, turning constantly with tongs, until leaves are wilted, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and season bok choy with salt to taste. Transfer to platter and serve."]

notes: "Bok choy can sometimes be sandy near the inner base of the head. Look for this sand when youre separating the stalks and make sure to remove it during rinsing. Look for heads of bok choy that weigh 4 to 6 ounces each."
