instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees.

Off heat, gently stir in 1 cup cheddar.","Transfer potato mixture to 13 by 9-inch baking dish, spread into even layer, and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheddar. Bake until bubbling around edges and top is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes.

notes: "Do not prepare the potatoes ahead of time or store them in water; the potato starch is essential for thickening the sauce. A mandoline makes quick work of slicing the potatoes. We prefer sharp cheddar for this recipe, but mild or extra-sharp cheddar can also be used. This recipe can easily be doubled. To do so, use a large Dutch oven instead of a large saucepan in step 1 and let the casserole cool for 30 minutes before serving in step 3."
