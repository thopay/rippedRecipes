description: "Most lemon square recipes seemed designed to please people who like the shortbread crust more than the lemon filling. We wanted a thick, creamy topping with bold—not puckering—lemon flavor."

time: ""
instructions: ["For the crust: Adjust rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving overhang on all sides.","Pulse flour, sugar, and salt in food processor 2 to 3 times. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal (some pea-sized pieces of butter will remain) and will stick together if squeezed into ball, about fifteen 1-second pulses. Sprinkle dough into prepared pan and press in even layer. Bake until light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.","For the filling: While crust is cooling, whisk eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt together in saucepan. Add zest and juice and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and pudding-like, 8 to 10 minutes. Press through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl. Stir in butter and cream.","Pour filling over crust and tilt to spread evenly. Bake until filling is set, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature, at least 1 hour, then, using foil overhang, lift bars from pan and cut into 9 squares. Dust with confectioners’ sugar just before serving. (Squares will keep in airtight container in refrigerator for 3 days. Redust with confectioners’ sugar before serving.)"]

notes: "Most lemon squares are far too sweet and none too lemony. We wanted to reverse that and make a crisp-crusted lemon square with a vibrantly bright lemon flavor. To make the crust without a food processor, grate the cold butter (do not cut it in 12 pieces) on the large holes of a box grater and toss into the flour, sugar, and salt mixture in step 2. Using a fork, press the butter into the mixture until it is the texture of coarse meal. Proceed to press and bake the crust as directed."
