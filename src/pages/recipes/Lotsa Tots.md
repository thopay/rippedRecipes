ingredients: ["4 1/2 teaspoons, salt","5 pounds, russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces","3 tablespoons, all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon, pepper","4 cups, peanut oil or vegetable oil"]
serves: 96
time: "1½ hours, plus 30 minutes freezing"
instructions: ["Whisk 2 cups water and salt together in bowl until salt dissolves. Working in two batches, pulse potatoes and salt water in food processor until coarsely ground, 10 to 12 pulses, stirring occasionally. Drain mixture in fine-mesh strainer, pressing potatoes with rubber spatula until dry (liquid should measure about 1½ cups for each batch); discard liquid. Transfer both batches of potatoes to bowl and microwave, uncovered, until dry and sticky, 12 to 14 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking.","Stir flour and pepper into potatoes. Spread potato mixture into thin layer over large sheet of aluminum foil and let cool for 10 minutes. Push potatoes to center of foil and place foil and potatoes in 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing it flush to pan. Press potato mixture tightly and evenly into pan. Freeze, uncovered, until firm, about 30 minutes.","Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat oil in Dutch oven over high heat until 375 degrees. Using foil overhang, lift potatoes from pan, cut the potato rectangle in half crosswise to yield 2 equal rectangles. Then cut each half into 48 pieces (5 cuts in one direction and 7 in other; pieces should be about 1 1/4 by 1-inch). Fry a quarter of the potato tots, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally once they begin to brown. Drain on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Bring oil back to 375 degrees and repeat three more times with remaining potato tots. Serve.","Make Ahead: Cool fried potato tots, transfer to zipper-lock bag, and freeze for up to 1 month. To serve, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Place potato tots on rimmed baking sheet and bake until heated through, 12 to 15 minutes."]

notes: "If your food processor has a capacity of less than 11 cups,&nbsp;you may need&nbsp;to process the potatoes in&nbsp;more than&nbsp;two batches. If any large pieces of potato remain after processing, chop them coarsely by hand. To make handling the uncooked tots easier, use a wet knife blade and wet hands."
