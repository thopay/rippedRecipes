instructions: ["Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add curry powder and cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add onions, jalapeno, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.","Add chicken and water to pot. Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken registers 160 degrees, 22 to 24 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking. Transfer chicken to plate and let cool for 5 minutes. Once chicken has cooled, use two forks to shred meat into approximate 2-inch pieces; discard skin and bones.","Meanwhile, stir potatoes and ¼ teaspoon salt into curry, cover, and cook until potatoes are slightly tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in cauliflower and continue to cook, covered, until potatoes are fully cooked and cauliflower is tender, about 15 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.","Stir in peas, cilantro, and shredded chicken and cook until curry is warmed through, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in yogurt. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve."]
