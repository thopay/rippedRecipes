description: "This recipe is the perfect example of making something from almost nothing, but we wanted a heartier version with serious chunks of ham-something we could serve as a main course for dinner."

ingredients: ["2 tablespoons, vegetable oil","1 pound, ham steak, patted dry and diced","1 , onion, chopped","3 , carrots, peeled and chopped","2 , celery ribs, chopped","6 , garlic cloves, minced","4 cups, low-sodium chicken broth","6 cups, water","2 (12-ounce), smoked ham hocks","1 pound, dried navy beans, soaked overnight (see note)","2 teaspoons, minced fresh thyme leaves","1/2 teaspoon, pepper","1 tablespoon, red wine vinegar"]
serves: 8
time: "2 hours"
instructions: ["Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until just smoking. Add diced ham and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Add onion, carrots, and celery and cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth, water, hocks, and beans. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans are completely tender and soup is slightly thickened, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.","Remove hocks from pot. (If desired, let cool 5 minutes, then shred meat and add to soup.) Stir in thyme, pepper, and vinegar. Serve.","Make Ahead: This soup can be refrigerated for several days, but the beans will continue to soak up liquid. If the soup becomes too thick, stir in 1/4 cup water at a time until the consistency is to your liking. Simmer the soup over medium-low heat until it's hot. Serve.","Soaking in a Hurry: When we need to soften beans in a hurry (or forget to start soaking them the night before), we use this shortcut method. Cover the beans with 3 inches of cold water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover, and remove the pot from the heat. Let the beans stand for an hour, then drain them and cook as directed."]

notes: "To speed up their cooking time, soak the beans in cold water for at least 8 hours (or up to 24 hours) before cooking."
