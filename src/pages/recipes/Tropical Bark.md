time: "15 minutes, plus 30 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.","Microwave 12 ounces chocolate in medium bowl at 50 percent power, stirring often with rubber spatula, until about two-thirds melted, 1½ to 2½ minutes (chocolate should be fluid but still lumpy). Remove bowl from microwave and add remaining 4 ounces chocolate. Stir and mash until chocolate is just melted and smooth, about 3 minutes. (If lumps remain, you may return chocolate to microwave at 50 percent power for no more than 5 seconds at a time, stirring at each interval, until fully melted.)","Working quickly, use offset spatula to spread chocolate evenly over prepared sheet. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts, coconut, lime zest, and salt, and gently press into chocolate. Let sit until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes (if your kitchen is warm, you can let bark set up briefly in refrigerator).","Transfer to cutting board; discard parchment. Cut or break into pieces. Serve."]
