ingredients: ["1/4 cup packed (1¾ ounces), light brown sugar","3 tablespoons, Dutch-processed cocoa powder","3 tablespoons, cornstarch","1/4 teaspoon, salt","2 3/4 cups, whole milk","1/4 cup, heavy cream","1 cup (6 ounces), milk chocolate chips","1/2 teaspoon, vanilla extract"]
serves: 4
time: "20 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling"
instructions: ["Combine brown sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt in large saucepan. Whisk milk and cream into sugar mixture until smooth. Add chocolate chips and bring to simmer, whisking occasionally, over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and large bubbles appear at surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in vanilla.","Transfer pudding to large bowl and place plastic wrap directly on surface of pudding. Refrigerate until completely cool, at least 4 hours. (Pudding can be refrigerated in airtight container for 3 days.) Serve.","Chill Faster, Eat Sooner: To some pudding lovers (especially little ones), waiting 4 hours to eat pudding seems like a lifetime. To speed the chilling, transfer the pudding to a 13 by 9-inch baking dish in step 2 and place plastic wrap directly on its surface. Place in freezer until completely cool, at least 45 minutes or up to 1 hour."]

notes: "Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Chips are our favorite brand. Using chips saves you the trouble of chopping, but 6 ounces of bar milk chocolate, chopped, works, too."
