serves: 4
time: ""
instructions: ["Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham steak and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add peppers and onion and cook until browned around edges, 6 to 7 minutes.","Reduce heat to medium and stir in 2 tablespoons butter. Once butter melts, pour in eggs, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, without stirring, until edges just begin to set, about 5 seconds, then, with rubber spatula, stir in circular motion until slightly thickened, 30 to 60 seconds. Using spatula, pull cooked edges toward center of pan, tilting pan to one side so that uncooked egg runs to edge of pan. Repeat until bottom of omelet is just set but top is still very runny, about 1 minute.","Cover skillet with lid, reduce heat to low, and cook until top of omelet is beginning to set but still moist, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and sprinkle omelet with cheese. Cover and let pan sit off heat until cheese is partially melted, about 1 minute.","Tilt pan and, using spatula, push half of omelet onto serving platter. Tilt pan so omelet flips onto itself and forms half-moon. Spread remaining tablespoon butter on omelet and let rest 1 minute before serving with Tabasco."]
