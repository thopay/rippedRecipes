serves: 12
time: ""
instructions: ["Combine raisins and orange juice in small bowl. Cover and microwave until steaming, about 1 minute. Let sit until raisins are softened, about 15 minutes.","Whisk milk, corn syrup, 1 egg and yolks, vanilla, almond extract, and orange zest in 2-cup liquid measuring cup until combined. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, yeast, and salt on medium-low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. With mixer running, slowly add milk mixture and knead until cohesive dough forms and no dry flour remains, 3 to 5 minutes, scraping down bowl and dough hook as needed.","With mixer still running, add butter 1 piece at a time until incorporated. Increase speed to medium-high and knead until dough pulls away from sides but still sticks to bottom of bowl, about 10 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add orange peel and raisins (plus any juice remaining in bowl), and knead until fully incorporated, about 2 minutes.","Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Form dough into tight ball and transfer to greased large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at warm room temperature (about 70 degrees) until doubled in size, about 2 hours.","Grease 8-inch cake pan. Pat dough into 12-inch disk on lightly floured counter. Working around circumference of dough, fold edges of dough toward center to form rough square. Flip dough over and, applying gentle pressure, move your hands in small circular motions to form dough into smooth, taut ball. Transfer ball, seam side down, to prepared pan. Cover loosely with greased plastic and let rise at room temperature until center is about 2 inches above lip of pan, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly beat remaining egg and brush over dough. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.","Rotate pan, tent with aluminum foil, and continue to bake until center of loaf registers 190 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Remove loaf from pan and let cool completely on wire rack, about 3 hours. Serve."]

notes: "Use an instant-read thermometer to make sure the milk is the correct temperature. If using a traditional 6 by 4-inch paper panettone mold, which you can find online or at kitchen supply stores, extend the baking time in step 7 by 10 minutes."
