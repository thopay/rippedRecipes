instructions: ["FOR THE PORK: Whisk buttermilk, dill, chives, cilantro, and salt in large bowl until salt is dissolved. Measure out 3 tablespoons buttermilk brine and set aside. Add pork to remaining brine and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.","FOR THE COATING: Combine all ingredients in large bowl. Add reserved 3 tablespoons brine and, using your fingers, rub flour mixture until craggy bits form throughout.","Working with 1 chop at a time, remove from brine, allowing excess to drip off, then coat with flour mixture, pressing to adhere. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate pork, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.","Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat to 375 degrees (to take temperature, tilt skillet so oil pools to 1 side). Carefully add 2 chops and cook until golden brown and registering 140 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes per side.","Transfer chops to prepared rack. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining chops. Serve."]

notes: "We prefer blade-cut pork chops here, but you can use pork rib chops, if desired. If youre using rib chops, use kitchen shears to snip through the fat surrounding the loin muscle of each chop in two places, about 2 inches apart, before marinating to prevent the chops from buckling while frying."
