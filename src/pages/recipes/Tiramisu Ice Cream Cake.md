serves: 10
time: "55 minutes, plus 5 hours freezing"
instructions: ["FOR THE SOAKED LADYFINGERS: Stir coffee, espresso powder, and 5 tablespoons rum in large bowl until espresso dissolves; set aside. Working with 1 cookie at a time, quickly dunk ladyfingers in coffee mixture and transfer to wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet; let sit 5 minutes.","TO ASSEMBLE: Grease tube pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper (see Tip). Lightly coat parchment with cooking spray. Line prepared pan with soaked ladyfingers, packing gently to ensure there are no spaces between cookies; freeze until firm, about 1 hour (see Step by Step). When cookies are firm, scoop ice cream into large bowl and mash with wooden spoon until softened; fold in chocolate chips. Transfer softened ice cream to cookie-lined pan, smooth top, and wrap with plastic. Freeze until ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours or up to 4 days.","TO SERVE: With electric mixer on medium speed, beat mascarpone, cream, sugar, and remaining tablespoon rum until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently invert pan to turn cake out onto serving platter and discard parchment. Using a rubber spatula, top cake with 1 cup mascarpone mixture and dust lightly and evenly with cocoa. Serve with remaining mascarpone mixture."]

notes: "Our version of the classic Italian trifle fills a ring of coffee-soaked ladyfingers with coffee-chip ice cream and crowns it with whipped cream enriched by mascarpone cheese. Topped with a light dusting of cocoa, this frozen cake is as elegant as it is easy to assemble. A large tube pan with a removable bottom works best here. If your tube pan doesn’t have a removable bottom, it may be necessary to soak the bottom of the pan in a large bowl of hot water for 30 seconds to help the frozen cake release from the pan."
