instructions: ["FOR THE SWEET POTATOES: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Poke potatoes several times with paring knife and space evenly on prepared sheet. Bake until potatoes are very tender and can be easily squeezed with tongs, 1¼ to 1½ hours. Let potatoes sit until cool enough to handle, at least 20 minutes.","Remove and discard potato peels. Transfer potato flesh to large bowl and mash with potato masher until smooth. Stir in melted butter, Grand Marnier, sugar, salt, and orange zest. Transfer potato mixture to 8-inch square baking dish and spread into even layer with rubber spatula.","FOR THE TOPPING: Whisk flour, brown sugar, salt, and cayenne together in bowl until fully combined. Stir in melted butter until mixture forms clumps. Break into pea-size pieces and distribute evenly over sweet potato mixture.","Bake until topping is fragrant and darkened slightly in color and potatoes are hot, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 25 minutes before serving.","TO MAKE AHEAD: At end of step 2, let sweet potato mixture cool completely. Cover dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, bake, covered, for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, uncover, and continue with step 3."]

notes: "Buy potatoes of similar size and shape, no more than 1 pound each, so they cook at the same rate. Orange juice can be substituted for the Grand Marnier, if you prefer."
