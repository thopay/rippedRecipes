notes: "Here we treat the scallions more like a green vegetable than an herb, cutting them into 1-inch lengths and sauteing them until lightly browned and tender. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 2 minutes.&nbsp;"
