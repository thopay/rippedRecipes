Add melted butter and pulse until combined, about 8 pulses. Transfer crumb mixture to greased 9-inch springform pan. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press crumb mixture firmly into bottom of pan. Bake crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.","FOR THE CAKE: Stir ice cream, 2½ cups whipped topping, and lemonade concentrate in bowl until combined. Pour half of ice cream mixture into cooled crust and smooth top with offset spatula. Transfer pan and bowl with remaining ice cream mixture to freezer and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Stir lemon curd, ½ teaspoon food coloring, and remaining 2½ cups whipped topping in separate bowl until combined. Spread lemon curd mixture in even layer over frozen ice cream layer. Return pan to freezer until firm, about 1 hour. Let remaining half of ice cream mixture soften, then spread over frozen lemon curd layer, smoothing top with offset spatula. Freeze cake until fully firm, at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.","Remove side of pan. Transfer cake to cake plate or pedestal. Smooth sides of cake with offset spatula. Dip 1-inch paintbrush in remaining ½ teaspoon food coloring and lightly drag across top of cake, painting straight yellow stripes 2 to 3 inches long, refreshing brush with food coloring as needed.
