description: "Recipes for low-fat brownies are not unknown, but so often theyre dry, gummy, or short on chocolate flavor-prune-flavored brownies, anyone? We injected our low-fat brownies with rich chocolate flavor and developed an irresistible, fudgy texture similar to traditional versions."

ingredients: ["3/4 cup (3¾ ounces), all-purpose flour","1/3 cup (1 ounce), Dutch-processed cocoa powder","1/2 teaspoon, baking powder","1/4 teaspoon, table salt","2 ounces, bittersweet chocolate, chopped","2 tablespoons, unsalted butter","2 tablespoons, low-fat sour cream","1 tablespoon, chocolate syrup","2 teaspoons, vanilla extract","1 , large egg plus 1 large egg white","1 cup (7 ounces), sugar"]
serves: 16
time: ""
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Fold two 12-inch pieces foil lengthwise so each measures 7 inches wide. Fit 1 sheet into 8-inch-square baking dish, pushing foil into corners and up sides of pan (overhang will help in removal of brownies). Repeat with second sheet, placing in pan perpendicular to first sheet. Spray foil with cooking spray.","Whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Melt bittersweet chocolate and butter in large bowl until smooth . Cool 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk in sour cream, chocolate syrup, vanilla, egg, egg white, and sugar. Using rubber spatula, fold dry ingredients into chocolate mixture until combined.","Pour batter into pan, spread into corners, and level surface with spatula. Bake until slightly puffed and toothpick inserted in center comes out with a few sticky crumbs attached, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool brownies completely in pan on wire rack, at least 1 hour. Remove brownies from pan using foil handles. Cut into 2-inch squares and serve. To keep brownies moist, do not cut until ready to serve. (Brownies can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for 3 days.)"]

notes: "Melt the chocolate and butter together in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water or in a microwave set to 50 percent power. For a truly fudgy consistency, dont overbake the brownies; as soon as a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with sticky crumbs attached, the brownies are done. If the toothpick emerges with no crumbs, the brownies will be cakey."
