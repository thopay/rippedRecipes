notes: "This recipe is adapted from Coconuts &amp; Collards: Recipes and Stories from Puerto Rico to the Deep South (2018) by Von Diaz. If you cant find ajies dulces or ajies amarillos, you can substitute half of a red, orange, or yellow bell pepper. Culantro, also called chadon beni and sawtooth coriander, has long leaves with jagged edges and a stronger, earthier flavor than cilantro. You can find it in the produce section of most Latin markets, as well as many Asian markets. If you cant find culantro, substitute cilantro."
