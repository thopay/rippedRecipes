title: Stuffed Cabbage Rolls
author: America's Test Kitchen
pubDate: 2023-03-15
description: "When done right, softened cabbage leaves, surrounding a filling of seasoned ground meat, are simmered in a smooth tomato sauce flavored with warm spices, sugar, and vinegar. Many times, however blown-out rolls are filled with chewy, flavorless meat and are swimming in a sugary sauce. Our recipe gently cooks the stuffed rolls in the oven to reduce the risk of roll blowout."
