Combine processed oats, remaining 1/3 cup oats, Grape-Nuts, sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, and salt in medium bowl; set aside.","FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Cut 3 apples into 1-inch pieces and slice remaining 3 apples into 1/4-inch-thick wedges. Bring apple pieces, apple juice, sugar, and cinnamon to simmer in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to bowl and mash apples using potato masher. Reserve 1 tablespoon mashed apple mixture. Return remaining mashed apple mixture to skillet with apple wedges and cook, covered, until wedges just begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice.","Scrape apple filling into 8-inch square baking dish and press into even layer. Add reserved mashed apple to topping mixture, stirring until mixture appears crumbly.
