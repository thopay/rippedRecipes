Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until incorporated, about 30 seconds.","Reduce speed to low, add sour cream, and beat until just combined. Add flour mixture until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until slightly firm, about 1 hour.","Meanwhile, line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees.","Working with about half of dough, drop heaping 1-tablespoon mounds of dough onto prepared sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake until just golden around edges, about 15 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.","Whisk lemon juice and cream cheese in bowl until combined. Add confectioners' sugar and whisk until smooth. Top each cooled cookie with 1 teaspoon glaze. Serve. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for 3 days.)"]
