time: ""
instructions: ["Melt butter in large stockpot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, garlic, ham, and sugar; cover and cook until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add peas, broth, water, and bay leaf; increase heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until peas are soft, about 40 minutes. Discard bay leaf and add pepper to taste. Serve.","Make Ahead","Split-pea soup can be refrigerated for several days or frozen for a month. Because split peas continue to soak up liquid over time, the soup may be dense when reheated. If the soup is too thick, stir in 1/4 cup water at a time until the consistency is to your liking. Simmer over medium-low heat until the soup is hot."]

notes: "The ham steak is very salty, so you probably won’t need to add salt to the soup. If you have any leftover roast ham in your refrigerator, feel free to use it in place of the ham steak (though you may need to adjust the seasonings)."
