Combine yolks, 5 tablespoons sugar, and sherry in large heatproof bowl. Set bowl over saucepan and whisk constantly until slightly thickened and mixture registers 160 degrees, 8 to 10 minutes. Refrigerate bowl and cool completely, about 1 hour. (Mixture must be cool before whipped cream is folded in.)","Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, remaining 7 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Fold whipped cream and 1¼ cups amaretti crumbs into cooled egg mixture until fully incorporated.","Divide mixture evenly among muffin cups, mounding tops. Top each with 1 cherry and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons amaretti crumbs. Freeze until slightly firm, about 1 hour, then cover lightly with plastic wrap and freeze until completely firm, at least 5 hours or up to 30 days. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving."]
