Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate. Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon fat; reserve bacon for filling.","Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Pulse flour, 1 tablespoon Parmesan, sugar, salt, and pepper in food processor until combined, about 3 pulses. Add oil and reserved bacon fat and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 12 pulses. Add water and process until dough begins to clump into large pieces, about 10 seconds. Transfer dough to prepared pie plate and press into even layer on bottom and sides of plate. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.","Spray 12-inch square sheet of aluminum foil with vegetable oil spray and press sprayed side against dough. Fill with pie weights and bake until top edge starts to color, about 30 minutes. Remove crust from oven, remove foil and weights, and sprinkle remaining 3 tablespoons Parmesan evenly over bottom of crust. Return crust to oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 7 minutes. Set on wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.","FOR THE FILLING: Whisk buttermilk, milk, eggs, cornstarch, salt, and pepper together in bowl until smooth. Stir in bacon and Gruyere. Pour filling into crust. Bake until center of quiche is set, 40 to 45 minutes. Let quiche cool on wire rack for 15 minutes. Serve."]
