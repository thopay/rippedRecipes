notes: "Remove the lime and orange zest with a vegetable peeler. Pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt. Do not overtrim the pork; this extra fat is essential to keeping the pork moist and helping it brown when sauteed in step 3. We like to serve carnitas with warmed corn tortillas and a variety of toppings, like finely chopped onion, fresh cilantro leaves, thinly sliced radishes, sour cream, and lime wedges."
