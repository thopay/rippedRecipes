serves: 6
time: "2 hours, plus 30 minutes cooling and 30 minutes marinating"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Place 16 by 12-inch piece of aluminum foil on rimmed baking sheet. Arrange beets in center of foil and lift sides of foil to form bowl. Add water to beets and crimp foil tightly to seal. Roast until beets can be pierced easily with fork, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.","Once beets are cool enough to handle, rub off skins with paper towels. Halve each beet vertically, then cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.","Whisk vinegar, oil, thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in large bowl. Add beets and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.","Arrange arugula on serving platter. Spoon beets over arugula and drizzle with remaining marinade.

notes: "To ensure even cooking, look for beets of similar size—roughly 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Red or golden beets will work equally well in this recipe. Peel the cooked beets over the leftover foil packet to minimize mess."
