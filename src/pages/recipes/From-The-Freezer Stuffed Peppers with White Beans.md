instructions: ["For the peppers: Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Cook onion until softened and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in beans.","Transfer bean mixture to large bowl and mix with rice, tomatoes, mozzarella, Parmesan, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 20 minutes.","Spoon filling evenly into bell peppers. Wrap each pepper with 2 layers of plastic wrap and 1 layer of foil. Place in baking dish and freeze until firm. Transfer to zipper-lock plastic bag and freeze up to 2 months.","When ready to serve: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut 8 pieces foil large enough to just cover stuffing in peppers, and spray with cooking spray. Unwrap peppers and cover filling sides with new foil squares. Using skewer, poke several holes through foil. Place peppers, foil side down, over vents of slotted broiler-pan top set over broiler-pan bottom. Brush peppers with oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake until peppers are spotty brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Flip peppers filling side up, remove foil, and sprinkle with mozzarella. Bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving."]

notes: "If you dont have leftover rice on hand, we recommend Uncle Bens Ready Rice. We prefer sweet red peppers in this recipe; green peppers, while traditional, were too bitter."
