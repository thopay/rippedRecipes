instructions: ["Spray V-rack with cooking spray. Pat chickens dry with paper towels and prick skin all over with skewer or paring knife. Combine sugar, salt, and pepper in small bowl, then rub seasoning mixture all over chickens. Tuck wings behind back and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Following photo 2 at left, arrange chickens head to tail on prepared V-rack.","Heat all burners on high for 15 minutes. Turn all burners to low. (For charcoal grill, light 100 coals; when covered with fine gray ash, spread in even layer over grill. Set cooking grate in place and heat, covered, with lid vent halfway open, for 5 minutes.) Scrape cooking grate clean.","Arrange V-rack on cooking grate and grill, covered, until back of each chicken is well browned, about 30 minutes, carefully rotating V-rack 180 degrees after 15 minutes. Flip chickens and repeat until breasts are well browned and thigh meat registers 155 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Brush chickens with glaze and continue grilling with lid on, flipping and glazing chicken every 5 minutes, until lightly charred in spots and thigh meat registers 170 to 175 degrees, 15 to 25 minutes.","Transfer chickens to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 10 minutes. Carve and drizzle chicken with remaining glaze. Serve.","Honey-Mustard Glaze: Simmer honey, Dijon mustard, and salt in small saucepan over medium heat until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. (Glaze can be refrigerated in airtight container for 3 days. Gently warm glaze in small saucepan or microwave before using.)"]
