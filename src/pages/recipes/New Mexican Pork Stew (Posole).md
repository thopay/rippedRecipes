Cook pork until well browned all over, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to plate. Add hominy to now-empty pot and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and hominy begins to darken, 2 to 3 -minutes. Transfer hominy to medium bowl.","SIMMER BROTH Heat remaining oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Puree onion mixture with softened chile mixture in blender.

notes: "Dont use store-bought chile powder. Dried ancho chiles make all the difference. Dried chiles can vary greatly in size, which is why were calling for a weight. If you dont have a kitchen scale, 3/4 ounce of ancho chiles is approximately one and one-half chiles. Serve the posole with sliced radishes and green cabbage, chopped avocado, hot sauce, and lime wedges."
