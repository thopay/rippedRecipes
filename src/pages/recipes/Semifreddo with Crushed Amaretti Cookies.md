ingredients: ["1½ cups, heavy cream","4 , large eggs","¾ cup (5¼ ounces), sugar","⅛ teaspoon, table salt","2½ ounces, amaretti cookies, crushed into ¼-inch pieces (about 1 cup)"]
serves: 8
time: "30 minutes, plus 8 hours freezing"
instructions: ["Line loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving 3-inch overhang on all sides. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream on medium-low speed until foamy, 30 to 60 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer cream to large bowl and cover with plastic; refrigerate until ready to use.","Whisk eggs, sugar, and salt together in medium heatproof bowl set over large saucepan containing 1 inch barely simmering water, making sure water does not touch bottom of bowl. Whisk continuously until egg mixture reaches 160 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes. Carefully separate bowl from saucepan and, using rubber spatula, transfer egg mixture to clean bowl of stand mixer. Using whisk attachment, beat on medium-high speed until mixture is thick, pale, and doubled in volume, 3 to 4 minutes.","Remove bowl from stand mixer. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in half of whipped cream until just incorporated, then fold in amaretti cookies. Fold in remaining cream until just incorporated and no streaks of cream remain. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Cover with plastic and freeze until firm, at least 8 hours or up to 2 weeks.","When ready to serve, remove plastic from top and invert pan onto cutting board or serving platter. Gently tug on overhanging plastic to release semifreddo from pan; discard plastic. Smooth surface with spatula, if desired. Dip slicing knife in hot water and wipe dry. Slice semifreddo about 1 inch thick, transferring slices to individual plates and dipping and wiping knife after each slice. Serve immediately."]

notes: "If amaretti cookies are unavailable, you can substitute shortbread cookies (note that their texture will be slightly softer); add ½ teaspoon almond extract to the egg mixture before beating in step 2 to replace the almond flavor of the amaretti, if desired. We prefer to heat the egg mixture in a heavy, heatproof glass or ceramic bowl in step 2; if you use a metal bowl, pay attention to the mixture as it heats, and whisk continuously to ensure that the mixture doesnt heat unevenly at the edges. Serve topped with Apricot-Honey Sauce, if desired."
