serves: 
time: "3 hours, plus 30 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Combine ketchup, salt, pepper, thyme, oregano, and rosemary in bowl. Rub ketchup mixture all over roast, then wrap roast with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours. Just before grilling, soak wood chips in water for 15 minutes, then drain. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent halfway. Light large chimney starter half filled with charcoal briquettes (3 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into steeply banked pile against side of grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat grill until hot and chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium-high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed to maintain grill temperature of 325 degrees.)","Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Unwrap roast. Arrange 18 by 12-inch sheet of foil on cooler side of grill and place roast on top of 1 end of foil. Loosely roll foil over roast, then tuck end of foil under roast to form loose cylinder around roast. Cook, covered, until meat registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 1½ to 1¾ hours. Remove roast from grill, transfer to prepared wire rack, and tent loosely with foil. Let roast rest for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into pile over spent coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes. Leave all burners on high.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Brush roast all over with oil. Grill (directly over coals for charcoal; covered if using gas), turning frequently, until charred on all sides, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer meat to carving board, slice thin, and serve."]
nutrition: ["null calories"]
notes: "For those of you using charcoal, this recipe calls for lighting two fires: the first to slow smoke the meat, and the second to sear it after a prolonged rest. For medium roast beef, cook it to an internal temperature of 130 to 135 degrees. You don’t need to rest the meat again after searing it in step 5; the roast may be served immediately."
