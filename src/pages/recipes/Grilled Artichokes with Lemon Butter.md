instructions: ["Cut off and discard bottom 1/4 inch of each artichoke stem. Remove any leaves attached to stems. Using vegetable peeler, peel away outer layer of stems. Pull bottom row of tough outer leaves downward toward stems and break off at base. Cut off and discard top quarter of each artichoke. Using scissors, cut off sharp tips of remaining leaves all around artichokes.","Combine 3 quarts water, 3 tablespoons salt, and pepper flakes in Dutch oven. Cut 1 lemon in half; squeeze juice into pot, then add spent halves. Bring to boil over high heat. Add artichokes, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until tip of paring knife inserted into base of artichoke slips easily in and out, 25 to 28 minutes, stirring occasionally.","Meanwhile, grate 2 teaspoons zest from remaining lemon; combine with butter, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Microwave at 50 percent power until butter is melted and bubbling and garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Squeeze 1 1/2 tablespoons juice from zested lemon and stir into butter mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Place artichokes stem side up on prepared rack and let drain for 10 minutes. Cut artichokes in half lengthwise. Using spoon, scoop out fuzzy choke, leaving small cavity in center of each half.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Brush artichokes with oil. Place artichokes on grill and cook (covered if using gas) until lightly charred, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer artichokes to platter and tent with aluminum foil. Briefly rewarm lemon butter in microwave, if necessary, and serve with artichokes."]

notes: "Look for artichokes that are bright green, with tightly packed leaves; avoid soft artichokes or those with brown splotches. The leaves should not appear feathery or dried out. To eat, use your teeth to scrape the flesh from the inner part of the exterior leaves. The tender inner leaves, heart, and stem are entirely edible."
