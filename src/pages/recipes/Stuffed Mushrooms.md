description: "So many stuffed mushroom recipes produce soggy and bland results. We wondered how to get flavorful, firm-yet-tender mushrooms that could be made ahead of time."

time: ""
instructions: ["For the topping: Pulse bread in food processor to coarse crumbs. Mix parsley, garlic, and oil in bowl. Stir crumbs into oil mixture to coat. Set aside.","For the mushrooms: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil and set wire rack inside baking sheet. Toss mushrooms with oil, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in bowl. Arrange mushrooms gill side up on rack and roast until juices are released, about 20 minutes. Turn caps over and roast until mushrooms are well browned, about 10 minutes.","Remove baking sheet from oven. Flip roasted mushrooms gill side up and cool slightly. Fill zipper-lock bag with stuffing and snip off one corner, then fill mushrooms. Press each cap (stuffing side down) into bread-crumb topping to coat and arrange (topping side up) on rack. Bake until filling is hot and topping is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool about 5 minutes before serving.","MAKE AHEAD: The mushrooms can be roasted and stuffed up to 3 days in advance, but don't top them with bread crumbs until you're ready to heat and serve the mushrooms. Store stuffed mushrooms, stuffing side up, on a paper towel-lined plate in the refrigerator, covered tightly with plastic wrap. The bread-crumb topping can be refrigerated separately for up to 3 days."]

notes: "Mushrooms shrink significantly as they cook, so  choose large stuffer mushrooms."
