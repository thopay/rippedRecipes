time: "2½ hours, plus 13½ hours cooling, chilling, and resting"
instructions: ["FOR THE GARLIC-HERB INJECTION: Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping bottom of saucepan with heat-resistant spatula, until milk solids are dark golden brown and butter has nutty aroma, 2 to 5 minutes longer. Off heat, stir in garlic, thyme, sage, rosemary, salt, and pepper and cook for 30 seconds (mixture will bubble up). Stir in broth.","Transfer butter mixture to blender and process until completely uniform and emulsified, about 2 minutes, scraping down sides of blender jar halfway through processing. Strain through fine-mesh strainer into 2-cup liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids with back of spoon to extract liquid. Let garlic-herb injection cool completely, 1 to 3 hours.","FOR THE TURKEY: Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Place turkey on prepared rack and pat dry inside and out with paper towels. Place turkey breast side up. Using kitchen shears, remove all excess skin and fat around neck, making sure opening around neck is clear, and remove tail.","Stir garlic-herb injection to recombine and fill injector. Inject each turkey breast in 3 places, working needle around in each injection site to distribute marinade throughout breast (using about 4 ounces marinade in each breast). Inject meatiest parts of each drumstick in 3 places (using about 1½ ounces marinade in each drumstick). Inject meatiest parts of each thigh in 3 places (using about 1½ ounces marinade in each thigh). Inject wings in flat and drumette with remaining marinade. Using paper towels, wipe any marinade from exterior of turkey.","Combine salt, sugar, and pepper in small bowl. Rub turkey with 2 tablespoons oil and rub all over with salt mixture. Tie legs together with kitchen twine. Tuck wings behind back and tie wings tightly to sides of turkey by tying single loop of twine around turkey at midline of breast. Refrigerate turkey for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.","Add enough oil to turkey fryer to reach maximum fill line and attach clip-on thermometer, making sure tip of thermometer is submerged in oil and not touching side of pot. When ready to cook, bring turkey outdoors and arrange on vertical turkey rack, making sure legs are positioned toward base of rack. Insert probe thermometer parallel to breast bone into thickest part of breast. Light turkey fryer and heat oil to 325 degrees over high heat.","When oil reaches 325 degrees, turn off heat and remove clip-on thermometer. Wearing protective grilling glove or oven mitt, very slowly lower turkey into oil until submerged. (Oil will bubble rapidly and top of breast may be exposed; this is OK.) Reattach clip-on thermometer and return heat to high. Fry turkey until breast registers 150 degrees, adjusting burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 300 and 315 degrees, 35 to 50 minutes. If breast registers 150 degrees before 35 minutes, tip of probe is likely not in thickest part; turn off heat, remove turkey from fryer, and adjust probe in breast. Return turkey to fryer, turn on heat, and continue to cook.","Turn off heat and remove clip-on thermometer. Carefully lift turkey, allowing excess oil to drip back into fryer, and transfer to clean rimmed baking sheet. Use instant-read thermometer to double-check for temperature of at least 150 degrees in breast (if temperature is lower, return turkey to oil, turn on heat, and cook until lowest temperature you can find is 150 degrees). Leaving probe thermometer in breast, bring turkey inside on vertical turkey rack and monitor breast temperature until it registers at least 160 degrees (and thigh registers at least 175 degrees). Continue to let turkey rest until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes longer. Carve turkey and serve."]

notes: "We developed this recipe with the Bayou Classic Stainless Steel 32-Quart Turkey Fryer and Gas One High Pressure Burner. If using a different turkey fryer, follow the manufacturers instructions for determining the appropriate amount of frying oil. Many turkey fryers come with meat injectors, but if yours doesnt, you can often buy them online or at cooking supply stores. We suggest serving this fried turkey with our&nbsp;Cranberry Chimichurri."
