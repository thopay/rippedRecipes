notes: "This cool fruit salsa is the perfect accompaniment to fiery jerk chicken. Grill the bananas and red onions alongside the chicken and then use them to make this salsa at the last minute. Slightly underripe bananas hold their shape especially well on the grill; however, other thickly sliced tropical fruits, including mangoes, papayas, or even pineapple, will work as well."
