Using 2½-inch biscuit cutter, cut out and remove circle from center of each piece of bread.","Remove hot sheet from oven and melt remaining 2½ tablespoons butter on it, tilting sheet to distribute evenly. Place bread circles down center of sheet and bread slices on either side of circles, buttered side up, in single layer. Return sheet to lowest oven rack and bake until bread is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes, flipping bread and rotating sheet halfway through baking.","Remove sheet from oven and set inside second (room-temperature) rimmed baking sheet. Crack 1 egg into each bread hole. Season with salt and pepper.

notes: "You will need two heavy-bottomed rimmed baking sheets; our favorite is the Wear-Ever Half Size Heavy Duty Sheet Pan (13 Gauge) by Vollrath. If you don’t have a biscuit cutter, cut the toast holes with a sturdy drinking glass."
