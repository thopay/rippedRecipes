Pat brisket dry with paper towels and season liberally with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place brisket in skillet, weigh down with Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet, and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer brisket to 13 by 9-inch baking dish.","Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add sliced onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour until onions are evenly coated and flour is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in pureed onion and cook until mixture has thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beer, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, sugar, and vinegar, scraping up any browned bits. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil.","Pour onion mixture over brisket and cover dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake until brisket is tender and fork easily slips in and out of meat, about 3 hours. Let brisket rest in liquid, uncovered, for 1 hour.","Transfer brisket to carving board. Skim fat from top of sauce with large spoon and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Whisk mustard into sauce and season with salt and pepper. Slice brisket against grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices and return to dish with sauce. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Follow recipe through step 3.

To serve, defat sauce, slice brisket, return to sauce, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 350 degrees until brisket is heated through, about 1 hour."]
