instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.","Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in medium bowl. Stir in 1/2 cup cheese, minced jalapeno, chives, and cayenne. Add 1 1/4 cups cream and stir with wooden spoon until dough forms, about 30 seconds.

notes: "Bake the biscuits immediately after cutting them. Allowing them to stand for any length of time can decrease the leavening power of the baking powder and prevent the biscuits from rising properly in the oven."
