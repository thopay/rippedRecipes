ingredients: ["1 (9-inch) single-crust, pie dough","1 large, egg white, lightly beaten","3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) plus 2 teaspoons, sugar","1 tablespoon, cornstarch","3/4 teaspoon, salt","2 large, eggs plus 5 large yolks","1 3/4 cups 1 percent low-fat, buttermilk","1/4 cup, heavy cream","4 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted and cooled","2 teaspoons, distilled white vinegar","1 1/2 teaspoons, vanilla extract"]
serves: 8
time: "1¾ hours, plus 1 hour chilling and 3½ hours cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE CRUST: Roll dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Transfer to 9-inch pie plate. Fold overhanging dough under itself so edge of fold is flush with outer rim of plate, and crimp edge. Refrigerate for 40 minutes, then freeze for 20 minutes. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees.","Line chilled pie shell with 2 (12-inch) squares of parchment paper, letting parchment lie over edges of dough, and fill with pie weights. Place pie plate on rimmed baking sheet and bake on lower-middle oven rack until lightly golden around edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Carefully remove parchment and weights, rotate sheet, and continue to bake until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Brush surface of hot crust with egg white (you won’t need all of it to coat crust) and bake for 1 minute longer.","FOR THE FILLING: Meanwhile, whisk 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk eggs and yolks into sugar mixture until well combined. Whisk buttermilk, cream, melted butter, vinegar, and vanilla into sugar-egg mixture until incorporated.","Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Whisk buttermilk mixture to recombine and, leaving pie shell in oven, carefully pour buttermilk mixture into hot pie shell. Bake for 10 minutes.","Sprinkle remaining 2 teaspoons sugar evenly over top of pie. Continue to bake until filling in center of pie registers 180 degrees (filling will jiggle slightly when pie is shaken; pie will set as it cools), 30 to 40 minutes. Remove pie from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees. Once oven comes to temperature, place pie on upper-middle oven rack and bake until golden brown on top, 5 to 7 minutes. Let pie cool for 30 minutes on wire rack. Transfer to refrigerator to chill, about 3 hours. Serve."]

notes: "All pies are best with homemade crust, and this one is no exception (find our recipe for Single-Crust Pie Dough in the related content section.) But if you lack the time, our favorite store-bought crust is Pillsbury Refrigerated Pie Crusts. Avoid nonfat buttermilk here."
