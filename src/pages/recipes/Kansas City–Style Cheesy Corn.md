instructions: ["Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Cook bacon in large saucepan over medium heat until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Add corn, ham, milk, cream cheese, granulated garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne to saucepan, breaking up cream cheese with rubber spatula. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cream cheese is melted and mixture just begins to bubble at edges of saucepan, 8 to 10 minutes (mixture will be liquid-y).","Off heat, stir in 1 cup cheddar until melted, about 30 seconds.

notes: "Frozen corn can be substituted for the fresh corn, if desired. A 14-ounce bag of frozen kernels will yield 3 cups. You will need a broiler-safe 1½-quart baking dish for this recipe. Do not use a Pyrex dish; it is not broiler-safe."
