Stir in 1/4 cup cheese.","Microwave spinach in large microwave-safe bowl, covered with plastic wrap, on high power until wilted, about 90 seconds. Transfer spinach to clean dish towel and squeeze out excess liquid. Microwave potatoes in now-empty bowl, covered with plastic wrap, on high power until tender, about 5 minutes.","Meanwhile, fry bacon in medium nonstick ovensafe skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 6 minutes. Transfer bacon to plate lined with paper towel and pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add potatoes to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, bacon, and egg mixture and cook, using rubber spatula to stir and scrape bottom of skillet, until large curds form but eggs are still very wet, about 2 minutes. Shake skillet to distribute eggs evenly and cook, without stirring, until bottom is set, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle remaining cheese over top.","Broil until surface is spotty brown, 3 to 4 minutes (eggs should be slightly wet and runny inside). Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes to finish cooking. Slide frittata onto platter and cut into wedges. Serve."]
