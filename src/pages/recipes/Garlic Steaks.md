time: "1 hour, plus 4 hours marinating"
instructions: ["FOR THE STEAKS: In 1-gallon zipper-lock bag, combine oil, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Place steaks in bag and seal. Turn bag to evenly coat steaks in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.","Remove steaks from marinade and rinse under cold water to remove any pieces of garlic; discard marinade. Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Sprinkle steaks with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper; set aside.","FOR THE GARLIC AND TOASTED GARLIC: Combine butter, minced garlic, salt, and pepper in bowl. Heat oil, thyme sprigs, and smashed garlic in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until garlic has softened and turned light brown, about 5 minutes, flipping garlic as needed to ensure even browning.","Remove garlic cloves from skillet with slotted spoon and set aside; discard thyme sprigs. Add 2 tablespoons hot garlic oil from skillet to butter mixture and whisk to combine (mixture should be emulsified and creamy). Set aside.","Heat remaining 2 tablespoons garlic oil in skillet over medium heat until just smoking. Add steaks and cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until well browned and meat registers 115 degrees (for medium-rare), 12 to 16 minutes. Transfer steaks to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Rewhisk sauce to make fluid again. Slice steaks thin and serve with sauce and reserved garlic cloves."]

notes: "We developed this recipe using a nonstick skillet, but a cast-iron skillet will also work well. If youre using table salt, use ½ tablespoon for the steaks and ¼ teaspoon for the garlic sauce and toasted garlic."
