time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Combine shrimp, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until edges of shrimp are just beginning to turn pink but shrimp are not cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp to clean bowl; set aside.","Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shallot, garlic, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.","Stir in water, orzo, zucchini, remaining ¾ teaspoon salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover; and cook until orzo is al dente and nearly all liquid has been absorbed, 6 to 9 minutes.","Off heat, stir in peas, Pecorino, and lemon zest until well combined. Arrange shrimp in circular pattern on top of orzo mixture. Lightly push shrimp down to nestle into orzo. Return skillet to medium heat and cook, uncovered, until orzo begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Cover and continue to cook until shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes longer.","Sprinkle with basil and drizzle with extra oil. Serve, passing extra Pecorino separately."]

notes: "You will need a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a tight-fitting lid for this recipe. Jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound) will also work here, although you may need to increase the cooking time in step 4 by a minute or so. We prefer untreated shrimp—those not treated with salt or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate. Most frozen E-Z peel shrimp have been treated (the ingredient list should tell you)."
