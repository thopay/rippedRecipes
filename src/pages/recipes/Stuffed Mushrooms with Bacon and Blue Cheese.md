Toss mushroom caps with oil, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ⅛ teaspoon pepper in large bowl. Arrange caps gill side up on prepared sheet and roast until juice is released, about 20 minutes. Flip caps and roast until well browned, about 10 minutes; set aside.","Meanwhile, pulse reserved stems, shallot, garlic, and ⅛ teaspoon pepper in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 14 pulses. Cook bacon in 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Add stem mixture to skillet and cook until golden brown and moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook until nearly evaporated and mixture thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Transfer to bowl and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in blue cheese, chives, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Flip caps gill side up. Divide stuffing evenly among caps. (Stuffed caps can be refrigerated for 1 day; increase baking time to 10 to 15 minutes.) Return caps to oven and bake until stuffing is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve."]
