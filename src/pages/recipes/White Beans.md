serves: 8
time: "1½ hours, plus 8 hours brining"
instructions: ["Dissolve 1½ tablespoons salt in 2 quarts cold water in large container. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.","Drain beans in colander and rinse well. Combine beans, 10 cups fresh water, and salt in Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook at gentle simmer until beans are barely al dente, 40 to 50 minutes. (During simmer, bubbles should just break surface of water.)","Turn off heat, cover pot, and let beans steep until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve beans from pot using slotted spoon or drain in colander for later use. (Beans can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 3 days. Alternatively, beans can be cooled, transferred to zipper-lock bags, and frozen for up to 1 month.)"]

notes: "Soaking the beans in a saltwater solution for at least 8 hours results in creamier beans that cook more evenly than if just soaked in water."
