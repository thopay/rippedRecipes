serves: 6
time: "55 minutes"
instructions: ["FOR THE FRIED CAPERS: Combine oil and capers in 2-cup liquid measuring cup (capers should be mostly submerged). Microwave until capers are darkened in color and have shrunk, about 5 minutes, stirring halfway through microwaving. Using slotted spoon, transfer capers to paper towel–lined plate (they will continue to crisp as they cool); set aside. Transfer 2 tablespoons caper oil to large bowl; set aside. (Reserve remaining caper oil for another use. Fried capers can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.)","FOR THE SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in small bowl. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","FOR THE GREEN BEANS: Bring 3 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat. Meanwhile, fill large bowl halfway with cold water; set aside. Add green beans and ¼ cup salt to boiling water. Once water returns to boil, cook green beans until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.","Drain green beans in colander and immediately transfer to bowl with cold water. Let sit until chilled, about 2 minutes. Drain in colander and dry thoroughly with clean dish towels. (Blanched green beans can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","Just before serving, transfer green beans to large bowl with caper oil. Add salt and pepper and toss until well combined. Arrange green beans in even layer on large platter. Drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with dill and fried capers. Serve."]
