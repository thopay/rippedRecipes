notes: "This recipe was developed using Morton &amp; Bassett Chili Powder, which is the test kitchen’s favorite chili powder and has no salt added; you may need to lower the salt in the chicken marinade if using chili powder with salt. We enjoy these fajitas with only the cilantro-lime sour cream, but you can also serve them with your favorite fajita toppings, such as shredded Monterey Jack cheese, salsa, guacamole, or hot sauce."
