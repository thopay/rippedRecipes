notes: "Our Zucchini Bread (see related recipe) is good enough to stand on its own, but a slather of cream cheese makes it  even better. Flavor that cream cheese with jam, spices, or citrus zest and you have something memorable. These  spreads will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for a week."
