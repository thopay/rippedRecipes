notes: "Use whole dried hibiscus flowers, not ones that have been cut and sifted. If you can find only ones that have been cut and sifted, use the weight listed (1½ ounces), not the volume. Steens is a popular brand of cane syrup. This recipe can be doubled; to do so, use a Dutch oven or another large pot in step 1."
