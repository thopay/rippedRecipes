notes: "Although a mix of red, orange, and yellow peppers will provide the prettiest appearance, this slaw can be made with just one type of bell pepper. For a spicier slaw, do not remove the inner flesh and seeds from the jalapeno. Very thin strips of bell pepper are essential for this recipe, so make sure your knife is plenty sharp. Serve the slaw as soon as possible after preparation. Most slaws shed a good deal of liquid quickly, and the flavors may turn watery and the texture soft."
