serves: 12
time: "2¾ hours, plus 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Arrange bread evenly on rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and stir bread to redistribute. Return sheet to oven and continue to bake until bread is light golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Let cool completely, then transfer to large bowl. (Cooled bread can be stored in zipper-lock bag for up to 2 days.) Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.","Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Continue to cook, swirling pan occasionally, until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer 3 tablespoons browned butter to small bowl and set aside.","Add onions and celery to skillet, increase heat to medium, and cook until vegetables are soft and beginning to brown, 10 to 13 minutes. Stir in poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with bread.","Add broth to bread mixture and fold to combine. Let sit for 10 minutes. Fold again until broth is fully absorbed. Transfer stuffing to 13 by 9-inch baking dish and distribute evenly but do not pack down. Drizzle reserved butter evenly over top. Bake until golden brown and crisp on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer dish to wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Serve. TO MAKE AHEAD: Before drizzling butter over stuffing in step 4, cover dish with aluminum foil. Refrigerate stuffing and reserved butter for up to 24 hours. To serve, microwave reserved butter until melted. Remove foil, drizzle butter over stuffing, re-cover dish with foil, and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until stuffing is heated through and top is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes longer."]
