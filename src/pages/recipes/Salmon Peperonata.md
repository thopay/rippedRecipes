notes: "To ensure uniform pieces, we prefer to purchase a whole center-cut salmon fillet and cut it into four equal pieces. Alternatively, you could purchase four 6- to 8-ounce skinless fillets of similar thickness. The most accurate way to assess the doneness of the salmon is with an instant-read thermometer."
