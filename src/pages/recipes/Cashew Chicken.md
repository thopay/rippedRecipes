serves: 6
time: "50 minutes, plus 30 minutes marinating"
instructions: ["For the marinade and sauce: Whisk 3 tablespoons mirin, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, and 2 tablespoons cornstarch in large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.","Whisk broth, Worcestershire, remaining mirin, remaining soy sauce, remaining sesame oil, and remaining cornstarch in separate bowl; set aside.","For the stir-fry: Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown half of chicken, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate and tent with foil; repeat with additional 2 teaspoons vegetable oil and remaining chicken.","Add remaining vegetable oil to empty skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook snow peas until bright green, about 1 minute. Add ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes to pan and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in water chestnuts and reserved broth mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Return chicken, along with any accumulated juices, to skillet and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in cashews. Serve."]

notes: "Toast the cashews on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Presliced water chestnuts can be waterlogged; for the crunchiest texture, use canned whole water chestnuts and slice them yourself. It is imperative to use low-sodium chicken broth in this recipe."
