serves: 8
time: "1 ¾ hours, plus 1 hour marinating and 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["MARINATE PORK Whisk 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup olive oil, and crushed garlic together in small bowl. Transfer mixture to large zipper-lock bag. Following photos at left, butterfly pork roast. Transfer roast to bag with marinade, seal, and turn to coat thoroughly. Refrigerate for 1 hour (or up to 4 hours).","MAKE PASTE Toast unpeeled garlic cloves in large skillet over medium heat, until fragrant and color deepens slightly, about 8 minutes. Set aside. When cool enough to handle, peel cloves. Mince 10 cloves and place in small bowl. Mash minced garlic with 1 tablespoon oil, red pepper flakes, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and set aside.","ROLL AND TIE Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Remove roast from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Spread surface of meat with garlic paste leaving 1/2-inch border on all sides. Roll tightly, then tie roast at 1-inch intervals with kitchen twine. Season with pepper. Heat remaining oil in empty skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown roast on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet.","ROAST LOIN Roast in oven until thickest part of meat registers 140 degrees, about 50 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, mince remaining 2 cloves toasted garlic and place in small microwave-safe bowl. Add butter and sugar and microwave until garlic is golden and butter has melted, about 1 minute, stirring halfway. Transfer pork to cutting board, brush with garlic butter, tent with foil, and let rest 20 minutes. Slice and serve."]

notes: "For easier butterflying, look for a pork roast that is short and wide (7 to 8 inches long and 4 to 5 inches wide). You need 2 heads of garlic for this recipe. Really."
