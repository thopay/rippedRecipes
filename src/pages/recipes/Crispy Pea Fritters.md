notes: "To move quickly through adding the batter to the hot oil, measure out the first 2-tablespoon portion of batter to get a visual on how much batter should be in each fritter, and then use a dinner spoon to portion out the rest by eye. You can make a quick dipping sauce for these fritters by combining some yogurt with a little lemon juice and salt. Alternatively, try dipping them in our Onion Raita. Sprinkle the warm fritters with flake sea salt, if desired."
