notes: "Be sure to choose the ripest tomatoes you can find. While this sauce is best when eaten right away, it can be frozen for up to one month. If you plan to freeze it, hold off on adding the basil until right before serving. If you’re using exceptionally sweet in-season tomatoes, omit the sugar."
