instructions: ["FOR THE PIZZA: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut bread in half crosswise, then halve each piece horizontally to create 4 equal pieces. Arrange pieces cut side down on prepared sheet. Brush crust with oil.","Combine melted butter, granulated garlic, salt, and pepper flakes in bowl. Flip bread cut side up and brush cut side evenly with melted butter mixture. Bake, cut side up, until browned around edges, about 5 minutes.","FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, combine all ingredients in bowl. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Spread sauce evenly over toasted bread, then top with mozzarella, followed by Parmesan, sausage, pepperoni, onion, bell pepper, and olives (in that order).

notes: "A 24 by 4-inch loaf of supermarket French bread, which has a soft, thin crust and fine crumb, works best here. If you cant find soft French bread, you can substitute one and a half 18-inch baguettes, though the crust will be slightly tougher. Cut the baguettes into six equal pieces, and distribute the toppings evenly."
