notes: "To perfect this tomato sandwich recipe, you’ll want to choose tomatoes that measure no more than 2 inches in diameter. The tomatoes should smell fruity and feel heavy for their size. Youre more likely to break up the tomatoes if you toss them with the marinade in a bowl; combining them in a zipper-lock bag is gentler. "
