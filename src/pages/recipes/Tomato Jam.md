notes: "It’s important to use plum tomatoes; globe tomatoes are juicier and need to cook longer. Use tomato jam in a turkey or egg salad sandwich, slather it on a burger, spread it on a buttered English muffin, or serve it with your favorite cheese. Store the jam in the refrigerator for up to two weeks."
