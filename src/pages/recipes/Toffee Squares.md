ingredients: ["1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces), all-purpose flour","1/2 teaspoon, salt","10 tablespoons, unsalted butter, softened","1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces), dark brown sugar","1/3 cup (1 1/3 ounces), confectioners' sugar","1/2 cup plain, toffee bits","1 cup (6 ounces), milk chocolate chips","3/4 cup, whole almonds, toasted and chopped coarse"]
serves: 24
time: "1 hour, plus 3 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray lightly with vegetable oil spray.","Combine flour and salt in bowl. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, brown sugar, and confectioners’ sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, scraping down bowl as needed, until dough becomes sandy with large pea-size pieces, about 30 seconds. Add 1/4 cup toffee bits and mix until combined.","Transfer dough to prepared pan and press into even layer using bottom of dry measuring cup. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.","Remove crust from oven, sprinkle with chocolate chips, and let sit until softened, about 5 minutes. Spread softened chocolate into even layer over crust using small offset spatula. Sprinkle almonds and remaining 1/4 cup toffee bits evenly over chocolate, then press gently to set into chocolate. Let bars sit at room temperature until chocolate is set, about 3 hours.","Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan. Cut into 24 pieces and serve. (Toffee squares can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "There are two kinds of toffee bits sold at the market; be sure to buy the ones without chocolate. Note that the squares need to cool for about 3 hours in order to set the chocolate; if you’re in a hurry, you can put the bars in the refrigerator for 1 hour. But don’t store them in the fridge much longer than that because the crust can become too hard."
