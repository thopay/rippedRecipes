Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil.","Combine oats, flour, sugar, almonds, baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Whisk melted butter, eggs, and vanilla together in second bowl. Stir butter mixture into flour mixture until dough forms. Set aside 1½ cups dough for topping. Press remaining dough into even layer in bottom of prepared pan.","Microwave chocolate chips, condensed milk, ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in bowl at 50 percent power until chocolate chips are melted and mixture is fully combined, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Mixture will resemble thick fudge.)","Transfer chocolate mixture to pan and spread evenly over crust. Crumble reserved dough and sprinkle pieces evenly over chocolate mixture. Bake until topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and let bars cool until set, about 6 hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan. Cut into 24 squares and serve."]
