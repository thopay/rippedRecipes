time: "1 hour, plus 2 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Lightly grease 8-inch square baking pan. Make parchment paper sling by folding 2 long sheets of parchment so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of parchment in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra parchment hanging over edges of pan. Push parchment into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing parchment flush to pan. Grease parchment.","Bring sugar, corn syrup, and butter to boil in Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring frequently with heat-resistant spatula. Off heat, stir in peanut butter until combined.","Gently stir in cereal until fully coated with sugar mixture. Transfer cereal mixture to prepared pan and press firmly into even layer with spatula. Let cool on wire rack for 15 minutes.","Microwave chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in bowl at 50 percent power, whisking occasionally, until melted and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes.","Using offset spatula, spread chocolate mixture evenly over cereal mixture. Sprinkle with salt, if using. Refrigerate bars until chocolate is firm, about 1hour.","Using parchment overhang, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting board. Let bars sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Cut into 16 pieces (3 cuts by 3 cuts). Serve. (Bars can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]

notes: "An equal weight of Rice Krispies cereal can be substituted for the Special K Original cereal and creamy peanut butter can be substituted for the chunky peanut butter, if desired. This recipe can easily be doubled and made in a 13 by 9-inch baking pan."
