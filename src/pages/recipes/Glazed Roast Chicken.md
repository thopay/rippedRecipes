notes: "Other jellies and preserves can be substituted for the red pepper jelly, if desired (apple and apricot both work well here). Preserves will have to be strained of their solid fruit before using. Note that the chicken is brushed with the glaze three separate times, and we divide the glaze into thirds so as not to double-dip after brushing the partially cooked chicken; be sure to wash and dry your brush between glaze applications."
