Add melted butter, eggs, vanilla, and milk mixture to flour mixture and whisk until mostly smooth. Let batter sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.","Whisk batter gently to deflate. Lightly coat cooking surface of waffle iron with vegetable oil spray. Cook waffles according to manufacturer's instructions until crisp, firm, and golden, 3 to 6 minutes (use about ¾ cup batter for 7-inch round Belgian waffle iron; adjust batter amount slightly as needed to spread batter to within ¼ inch of edge of iron), whisking batter between batches.

notes: "One envelope of instant yeast is 2¼ teaspoons. Even if your waffle maker has an indicator light or audio alert to let you know when the waffles are supposed to be done, we suggest following the visual cues in the recipe to determine doneness. We recommend serving the waffles with maple syrup, Banana-Nut Butterscotch Sauce, or Buttery Blueberry Maple Syrup."
