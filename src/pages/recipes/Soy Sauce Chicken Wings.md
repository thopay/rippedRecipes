notes: "We prefer to buy whole chicken wings and butcher them ourselves because they tend to be larger than wings that come presplit. If you can find only presplit wings, opt for larger ones, if possible. Three pounds of chicken wings is about 12 whole chicken wings, which will yield about 24 pieces of chicken (12 drumettes and 12 flats) once broken down."
