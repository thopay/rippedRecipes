instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Place chicken breasts on large plate and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.","Meanwhile, place 1/2 cup cornstarch in shallow dish. Whisk eggs and milk together in second shallow dish. Whisk broth, wine, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch together in bowl.","Working with 1 breast at a time, starting at thick end, cut breasts in half horizontally. Using meat pounder, gently pound each cutlet between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to even 1/4-inch thickness. Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in cornstarch, shaking off excess; dip in egg mixture to coat, letting excess drip off; then place on large plate in single layer.","Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Transfer 4 cutlets to skillet and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side, using fork to flip. Transfer to prepared rack and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with 2 tablespoons butter and remaining 4 cutlets.","Add capers and garlic to now-empty skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth mixture to skillet and bring to boil. Cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons butter.","Transfer chicken to serving platter. Spoon sauce over chicken and sprinkle with parsley. Serve."]

notes: "Freezing the chicken breasts for just 15 minutes makes them easier to slice into cutlets. To help keep the fragile egg coating in place, use a fork instead of tongs to flip the cutlets. Reese Non Pareil Capers are our favorite capers."
