ingredients: ["1 tablespoon, fennel seeds, toasted","1½ pounds coarsely, ground pork","1½ teaspoons, sugar","1½ teaspoons, salt","1 , large garlic clove, minced to paste","¾ teaspoon, pepper","¼ teaspoon, dried oregano","¼ teaspoon, red pepper flakes","2 teaspoons, vegetable oil"]
serves: 8
time: "40 minutes, plus 1 hour refrigerating"
instructions: ["Place fennel seeds in small zipper-lock bag and seal bag. Using rolling pin, roll over seeds 2 or 3 times to coarsely crack.","Combine pork, sugar, salt, garlic, pepper, oregano, pepper flakes, and fennel seeds in bowl of stand mixer. Fit mixer with paddle and mix on low speed until mixture is thoroughly combined and looks sticky, 60 to 90 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Cover and refrigerate mixture for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld before using. (Sausage mixture can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","Using your wet hands and working with ½ cup sausage at a time, form six 4-inch-diameter patties, about ½ inch thick. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add 3 patties to skillet and cook until browned on both sides and meat registers 160 degrees, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer patties to serving platter and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining 1 teaspoon oil and remaining 3 patties. Transfer to platter and serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Transfer uncooked patties to parchment paper–lined baking sheet and place sheet in freezer. Transfer frozen patties to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to cook, increase cooking time to 6 minutes per side."]

notes: "Let the toasted fennel seeds cool completely before cracking them in step 1. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of turning the garlic into a paste. If you cant find coarsely ground pork (you may have to ask your butcher), you can substitute finer, more commonly available regular-grind pork, but the texture of the sausage will be denser. If desired, you can grill the patties over a medium-hot fire until theyre lightly charred and register 160 degrees, about 4 minutes per side."
