ingredients: ["1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons, warm milk (110 degrees)","1 , large egg","2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (10⅝ ounces), all-purpose flour","1 1/2 teaspoons, instant or rapid-rise yeast","2 tablespoons, sugar","1 teaspoon, table salt","4 tablespoons, unsalted butter, softened","1 1/4 cups (8¾ ounces), sugar","4 teaspoons, ground cinnamon","1/2 teaspoon, table salt","12 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted, divided"]
serves: 15
time: "1¾ hours, plus 2 hours rising"
instructions: ["FOR THE DOUGH: Whisk milk and egg together in bowl of stand mixer. Add flour and yeast. Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, about 2 minutes, scraping down dough hook and bowl as needed. Let stand for 15 minutes.","Add sugar and salt and mix on medium-low speed for 5 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, scraping down dough hook and bowl occasionally (dough will stick to bottom of bowl). Transfer dough to greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.","FOR THE COATING: Combine sugar, cinnamon, and salt in bowl. Reserve ¾ cup cinnamon sugar. Place remaining cinnamon sugar in shallow dish. Place 6 tablespoons melted butter in second shallow dish.","Grease 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Turn out dough onto counter and divide into fifteen 1⅓-ounce portions; divide any remaining dough evenly among portions. Working with 1 portion at a time, cup dough with your palm and roll against counter into smooth, tight ball.","Working with 3 or 4 dough balls at a time, roll dough balls in melted butter in shallow dish, then roll in cinnamon sugar in shallow dish. Place dough balls in prepared dish in 3 rows of five. Cover loosely with plastic and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour (cinnamon sugar coating may crack during rising; this is OK). Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.","Bake until rolls are puffed and golden brown and register at least 200 degrees in center, about 25 minutes. Whisk reserved cinnamon sugar and remaining 6 tablespoons melted butter in bowl until combined (mixture may look separated). Brush tops and sides of hot rolls with cinnamon sugar–butter mixture (use all of it) and let cool in dish for 10 minutes. Remove rolls from dish and serve warm.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Before letting dough balls rise for second time in step 5, cover baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Let dough balls sit at room temperature for 1 hour before baking."]

notes: "We developed this recipe using a 4½-quart stand mixer. If using a larger mixer, you may need to increase the mixing time after adding the butter in step 2 to about 10 minutes. If the dough doesnt come together in the mixer, switch to a paddle attachment and mix just until the dough comes together. Then switch back to the dough hook and keep kneading. Use an instant-read thermometer to make sure that the milk is the correct temperature. We developed this recipe using a ceramic baking dish. If you choose to use a metal baking pan, reduce the baking time to 20 minutes. The slight tackiness of the dough aids in rolling it into smooth balls in step 4, so do not dust your counter with flour."
