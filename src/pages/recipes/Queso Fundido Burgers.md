instructions: ["Shape beef into four 3/4-inch-thick patties and make shallow indentation in center of each. Season with salt and pepper. Combine chorizo, water, poblano, onion, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in 12-inch nonstick skillet and cook, covered, over high heat until chorizo is cooked through and vegetables are softened, 8 to 10 minutes, uncovering occasionally to break meat into small pieces with spoon. Uncover and cook until water is completely evaporated and mixture begins to brown, 1 to 3 minutes.","Reduce heat to medium and divide chorizo mixture into 4 even piles in skillet. Press 1 beef patty, indentation side down, firmly into each pile. Cook until well browned, about 4 minutes. Flip patties and cook until beef registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), about 2 minutes. Top burgers with Colby Jack, cover, and cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Place burgers on buns and top with lettuce and jalapenos. Serve."]
