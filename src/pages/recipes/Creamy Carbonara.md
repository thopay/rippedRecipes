description: "At its best, pasta carbonara is a velvety smooth blend of eggs, cream, cheese, bacon, and pepper. We wanted to make a pasta carbonara as good as that served in Rome"

notes: "Although we call for spaghetti in this recipe, you can substitute any long thin pasta, such as linguine or fettuccine. Parmesan cheese can be substituted for the Pecorino Romano, though the sauce will not be as creamy or as flavorful. To avoid curdling the eggs, be sure to whisk constantly when adding the hot ingredients to the egg mixture. If you like your food extra-peppery, increase the pepper to 1 1/2 teaspoons."
