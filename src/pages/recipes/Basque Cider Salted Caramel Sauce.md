serves: 10
time: "55 minutes"
instructions: ["Bring cider and sugar to boil in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook without stirring until mixture is syrupy and full of large bubbles and registers about 250 degrees, 25 to 35 minutes.","Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until mixture is deep amber–colored and registers 320 to 330 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer. (Watch caramel closely during final minutes of cooking since temperature can increase quickly.)","Off heat, carefully whisk in cream and salt (mixture will bubble and steam).

Cooled sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks; reheat before serving.)"]
