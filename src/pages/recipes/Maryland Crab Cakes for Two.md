Press 1 side of each ball into remaining saltine crumbs, flattening saltine side slightly while keeping opposite side rounded, then place crumb side down on plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.","Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Grease 10-inch skillet with softened butter.

notes: "Fresh crabmeat may be hard to come by, but its flavor is superior to that of pasteurized. If your crabmeat smells clean and fresh when you open the package, skip the soaking process in step 1. These crab cakes make for a nice entree when served with a salad."
