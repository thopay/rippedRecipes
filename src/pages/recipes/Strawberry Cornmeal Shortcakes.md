serves: 8
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["FOR THE STRAWBERRIES: Gently toss all ingredients together in bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Taste strawberry mixture for sweetness and add extra sugar if needed.","FOR THE SHORTCAKES: Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour, cornmeal, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk and egg in separate bowl until combined; add melted butter and stir until butter forms clumps.","Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated. Lightly spray 1/3-cup dry measuring cup with vegetable oil spray. Stagger 8 level portions of batter on prepared sheet, about 1 1/2 inches apart. Sprinkle tops with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until shortcakes are golden brown, about 14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer shortcakes to wire rack and let cool for at least 10 minutes.","FOR THE WHIPPED CREAM: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes.","Split each shortcake in half horizontally. Spoon 1/2 cup strawberry mixture over each shortcake bottom, followed by 1/3 cup whipped cream; top with shortcake tops. Serve, passing any remaining whipped cream separately."]

notes: "Because the sweetness level of strawberries can vary, taste the macerated berries and add up to 2 tablespoons of extra sugar, if needed. While the shortcakes are best served warm, the cooled cakes can be stored in a zipper-lock bag at room temperature for 24 hours. They will lose some of their crispness, but you can bring it back by warming them in a 300-degree oven for 10 minutes."
