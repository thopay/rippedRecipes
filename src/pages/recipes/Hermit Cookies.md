description: "Most versions of this old-fashioned cookie bake up rock-hard and overly spiced. Our recipe revives this New England specialty to what it should be: soft and chewy, with a perfect balance of sugar and spice."

ingredients: ["1 cup, raisins","2 tablespoons, crystallized ginger, finely chopped (see note)","8 tablespoons, unsalted butter","1 teaspoon, ground cinnamon","1/4 teaspoon, ground allspice","2 cups (10 ounces), all-purpose flour","1/2 teaspoon, baking soda","1/2 teaspoon, salt","3/4 cup packed (5¼ ounces), dark brown sugar","1/2 cup, molasses (see note)","2 large, eggs","3/4 cup (3 ounces), confectioners' sugar","1 1/2 tablespoons, orange juice"]
serves: 20
time: "1½ hours, plus 1½ hours chilling and 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Process raisins and ginger in food processor until mixture sticks together and only small pieces remain, about 10 seconds. Transfer mixture to large bowl.","Melt butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling saucepan occasionally, until nutty brown in color, about 10 minutes. Stir in cinnamon and allspice and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Stir butter mixture into raisin mixture until well combined; let cool completely.","Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Stir brown sugar, molasses, and eggs into cooled butter-raisin mixture until incorporated. Using rubber spatula, fold in flour mixture (dough will be very sticky). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 1½ hours or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer dough to counter and divide into quarters. Roll 1 piece of dough into 10-inch log on lightly floured counter. Transfer log to prepared sheet and use ruler to neatly square off sides (each sheet will contain 2 logs). Repeat with remaining dough. Bake until only slight indentation remains on edges when touched (center will appear slightly soft), 15 to 20 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then slide cookies, still on parchment, onto wire rack. Let cookies cool completely.","Whisk confectioners' sugar and orange juice in small bowl until smooth. Drizzle glaze onto cooled cookies and let sit until glaze dries, about 15 minutes. Cut cookies into 2-inch bars before serving. (Hermits can be stored at room temperature for up to 5 days.)"]

notes: "Crystallized (or candied) ginger is available in the spice aisle of most supermarkets. For this recipe, we prefer using mild (or light) molasses instead of the robust or blackstrap varieties."
