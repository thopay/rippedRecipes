serves: 2
time: "1¼ hours, plus 30 minutes marinating"
instructions: ["Combine oil, garlic, 1½ teaspoons thyme, lemon zest, 1½ teaspoons salt, rosemary, coriander, pepper flakes, and pepper in large bowl. Cut two ½-inch-deep slits in skin side of each chicken piece. Add chicken to bowl with marinade and toss to coat, making sure marinade gets into slits. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place chicken, skin side up, in 10-inch ovensafe skillet. Using rubber spatula, scrape any remaining marinade from bowl over chicken. Roast until thighs register at least 170 degrees or breasts register 155 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes.","Meanwhile, bring 2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan. Add bulgur and 2 teaspoons salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 6 to 10 minutes. Drain bulgur and return to saucepan; cover to keep warm.","Using pot holders, remove skillet from oven; spoon pan juices over chicken. Heat broiler. Broil chicken until skin is lightly browned and thighs register at least 175 degrees or breasts register 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes, rotating pan as needed for even browning. Let chicken rest in pan for 10 minutes.","Transfer chicken to serving plates. Whisk lemon juice, remaining 1 teaspoon thyme, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt into pan juices, scraping up any browned bits. Drizzle 3 tablespoons pan sauce over bulgur. Fold tomatoes and parsley into bulgur mixture until evenly combined and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve chicken with bulgur, passing any extra pan sauce separately."]
