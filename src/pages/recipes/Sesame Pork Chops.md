ingredients: ["1/4 cup, sesame seeds","1 box, sesame-flavored Melba toasts (5-ounces), broken into rough pieces","1/2 teaspoon, table salt","1/2 teaspoon, garlic powder","1/2 teaspoon, onion powder","1/2 teaspoon, paprika","1/2 teaspoon, dried thyme","1/8 teaspoon, sugar","6 tablespoons, mayonnaise","4 , center-cut boneless pork chops, 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick (each 6 to 7 ounces), patted dry with paper towels"]
serves: 4
time: ""
instructions: ["Toast sesame seeds in small skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and golden, 4 to 5 minutes.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Place toasted sesame seeds, Melba toast pieces, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, thyme, and sugar in heavy-duty zipper-lock freezer bag. Seal bag and pound with heavy blunt object (such as a rolling pin) until Melba toasts are crushed but still have some crumbs the size of small pebbles. Add 2 tablespoons mayonnaise to bag and work mayonnaise evenly into crumb mixture by gently squeezing outside of bag. Transfer Melba crumb mixture to large plate.","Using your fingers, coat 1 chop with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise. Transfer to plate with Melba crumbs, sprinkle top of pork chop with some Melba mixture, and press down firmly on chop to adhere crumbs. Flip chop and repeat, making sure that thick layer of crumbs coats both sides and edges. Transfer breaded pork chop to baking rack set over rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chops.","Bake pork chops until juices run clear and instant-read thermometer inserted into center of chop registers 145 to 150 degrees, 16 to 22 minutes. Remove chops from oven and let rest on rack for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately."]

notes: "For a substantial crust, dont break up the Melba toasts too much, and coat the chops well with mayonnaise. Although an instant-read thermometer takes the guesswork out of determining when the meat is done, you can use the nick-and-peek method: Use a paring knife to make a slit in the top of the pork chop and take a look at the meats interior. The Melba crumbs can be made weeks in advance and stored in the freezer. This variation is a great match with our Five-Spice Applesauce."
