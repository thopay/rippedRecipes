notes: "Use a nonstick muffin tin or the eggs will stick. You can prepare the egg and filling mixtures up to a day in advance; refrigerate them separately. You can use our Asparagus, Dill, and Goat Cheese Filling; Chorizo, Parsley, and Pepper Jack Filling; Potato, Bell Pepper, and Cheddar Filling; or Mushroom, Chive, and Gruyere Filling. Make two different types of frittatas in a single muffin tin by making half batches of two different filling recipes. You’ll need to reduce the saute time to 8 to 10 minutes and use a 10-inch skillet."
