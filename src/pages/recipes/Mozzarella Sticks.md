serves: 6
time: "45 minutes, plus 1 hour freezing"
instructions: ["Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack with triple layer of paper towels. Slice mozzarella crosswise into six 1/2-inch-wide planks. Cut each plank lengthwise into 3 equal sticks. (You will have 18 pieces.)","Spread flour in shallow dish. Beat eggs in second shallow dish. Pulse panko, salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder in food processor until finely ground, about 10 pulses; transfer to third shallow dish.","Working with 1 piece at a time, coat sticks with flour, shaking to remove excess; dip in eggs, allowing excess to drip off; and dredge in panko mixture, pressing to adhere. Transfer to plate. Freeze sticks until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours.","Add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 1 1/2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 400 degrees. Add 6 sticks to hot oil and fry until deeply browned on all sides, about 1 minute. Adjust burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 375 and 400 degrees.","Transfer sticks to paper towel–lined side of prepared rack to drain for 30 seconds, then move to unlined side of rack. Return oil to 400 degrees and repeat frying in 2 more batches with remaining 12 sticks. Serve with marinara."]

notes: "Do not use fresh or part-skim mozzarella in this recipe; their high moisture content can cause the sticks to rupture in the hot oil. This recipe was developed with Sorrento Galbani Whole Milk Mozzarella, which is the test kitchen’s favorite. We do not recommend using string cheese. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more for this recipe."
