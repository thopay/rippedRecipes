notes: "Look for brussels sprouts that are similar in size, with small, tight heads that are no more than 1½ inches in diameter. If you have any very small brussels sprouts, cut them in half rather than quarter them. We call for a dry-cured Spanish-style chorizo for this recipe, not the fresh Mexican variety. Manchego is a Spanish sheeps-milk cheese; its sold in both fresher and more aged varieties, and either will work well here. If you cant find Manchego, you can substitute Pecorino Romano or extra-sharp cheddar cheese."
