instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and grease parchment. Combine 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and water in bowl and microwave until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute; set aside.","Whisk egg and yolk, brown sugar, milk, and vanilla together in bowl until frothy; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, mix flour, remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined. Increase speed to medium, add butter, and mix until mixture resembles coarse meal, 3 to 5 minutes. Add egg mixture and mix until dough just comes together, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl as needed.","With floured hands, break off handful of dough and roll into ¾-inch-thick rope on lightly floured counter. Cut rope into 1½-inch lengths. Dip tops of cookies into reserved sugar syrup, then sesame seeds, and place cookies 3 inches apart on prepared sheets, seed side up. Bake until lightly browned, 18 to 24 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely before serving, about 30 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough, sugar syrup, and sesame seeds. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]

notes: "The amount of time you’ll need in step 2 to combine the butter with the flour mixture will depend on how soft the butter is. Make sure the butter is fully incorporated, with no large chunks remaining, but don’t let the mixture form a cohesive mass. Remember to grease the parchment paper—otherwise, the syrup can make the cookies stick."
