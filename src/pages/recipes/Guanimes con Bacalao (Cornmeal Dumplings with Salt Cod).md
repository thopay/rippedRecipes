serves: 4
time: "1¾ hours, plus 24 hours soaking"
instructions: ["FOR THE BACALAO: Rinse salt cod of excess surface salt. Place cod in medium bowl and cover with about 2 quarts water. Transfer to refrigerator and let cod soak for 24 hours, changing water halfway through soaking.","Heat oil and annatto seeds in small saucepan over low heat, swirling occasionally, until bubbles begin to form around seeds and oil takes on deep orange color, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes. Strain oil through fine-mesh stainer into liquid measuring cup and set aside; discard seeds. (Annatto oil can be stored in airtight container for up to 1 week.)","Drain cod. Place cod in large saucepan, cover with 2 quarts water, and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water. Drain cod; transfer to bowl; and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Using your fingers or potato masher, flake or mash cod until finely shredded. (Shredded cod can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","Heat ¼ cup annatto oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, Cubanelle, ajies dulces, garlic, salt, and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 7 minutes.","Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Stir in cod and reserved cooking water and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low; cover; and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture deepens in color and flavors meld, about 15 minutes. Off heat, stir in recao or cilantro and olives. Season with salt to taste and cover to keep warm.","FOR THE GUANIMES: Bring 1½ cups water and salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Once boiling, immediately remove from heat. Using wooden spoon, quickly stir in cornmeal until mixture thickens and no lumps remain. Let mixture cool for 3 to 5 minutes. Divide guanimes mixture into 20 equal portions, about 1 tablespoon each. Roll guanimes between your lightly moistened hands to form smooth balls and transfer to plate. (Shaped guanimes can be refrigerated in zipper-lock bag for up to 24 hours.)","Bring 3 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. (Simultaneously begin reheating bacalao mixture if necessary.) Drop guanimes into boiling water and cook until beginning to float, about 5 minutes. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer 5 guanimes to each of 4 serving bowls. Top with bacalao mixture and drizzle with remaining annatto oil to taste. Serve."]

notes: "If possible, use pieces of salt cod that vary in thickness. The thicker pieces will remain saltier after soaking and boiling, and the thinner pieces will be less salty. Its ideal to have this variety. If you can find only thinner tail pieces of salt cod (about ½ inch or less), then soak it for only 18 hours (still changing the water once). Although the guanimes can be shaped ahead of time, boil them only just before serving and once the cod mixture is finished cooking. Guanimes are best when eaten immediately after boiling (their texture will become dense and dry the longer they sit). We developed the guanimes recipe using Quaker Yellow Corn Meal. We strongly recommend weighing the cornmeal here. If you cant find ajies dulces, you can substitute ½ cup of chopped red bell pepper; the flavor of the dish will be slightly different, though still very good."
