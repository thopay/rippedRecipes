Let stand until pliable, about 5 minutes.","Drain chiles and transfer to blender. Add broth, vinegar, orange juice, sugar, 1¼ teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and process until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed. Set aside adobo.","Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle with remaining ½ teaspoon salt and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.","Add onion to now-empty pot and reduce heat to medium. Cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, oregano, cumin, cinnamon, and orange zest and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk in adobo until combined. Return chicken, skin side up, to pot along with any accumulated juices; bring to simmer. Transfer pot to oven and bake, uncovered, until chicken is tender and breasts register 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs register 175 degrees, 35 to 40 minutes.","Transfer chicken to platter.

notes: "One ounce of guajillo chiles is about eight chiles; ½ ounce of ancho chiles is approximately one chile. Remove the strips of orange zest with a vegetable peeler. You can use all white-meat or all dark-meat chicken pieces, if desired. Serve with rice or warm flour tortillas."
