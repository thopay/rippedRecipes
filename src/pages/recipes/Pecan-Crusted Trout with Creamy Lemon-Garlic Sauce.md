serves: 4
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Combine mayonnaise, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, lemon juice, and garlic in bowl. Chill until ready to serve. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)","Process pecans and panko in food processor until pecans are finely chopped and mixture resembles coarse meal, 10 to 12 pulses. Transfer to shallow dish. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, cayenne, and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest. Whisk egg, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in second shallow dish.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Place wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Cut each trout in half lengthwise along natural seam between fillets to yield 2 fillets (you should have 6 fillets in total). Pat trout dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.","Working with 1 fillet at a time, dredge flesh side of trout in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Dip egg-coated side of trout in pecan mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer trout, pecan side up, to large plate and repeat with remaining fillets.","Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place 3 fillets in skillet, pecan side down and in alternating directions to fit. Cook until pecan coating is browned and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Using 2 thin spatulas, carefully flip fillets. Continue to cook until skin is browned and trout flakes easily with fork, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer trout, pecan side up, to wire rack and keep warm in oven.","Wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 3 fillets. Serve with lemon-garlic sauce."]

notes: "Only the flesh side of the trout gets coated with the pecan mixture. Note that the lemon zest is divided. If you store your pecans in the freezer, let them come to room temperature before processing for best results."
