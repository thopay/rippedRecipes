serves: 12
time: "1 hour, plus 24 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Set canning rack in canning pot and fill pot with water. Place 4 open 1-pint canning jars on rack in pot, making sure jars are covered by 1 inch water. Cover pot and bring to simmer over high heat. Turn off heat and let jars sit in hot water until needed.","Meanwhile, bring 3 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven. Fill large bowl halfway with ice and water. Score small X at base of each peach with paring knife.","Lower peaches into boiling water with slotted spoon. Cook until skins loosen at base of peaches, about 1minute. (Firmer peaches may need up to 3 minutes.) Using slotted spoon, immediately transfer peaches to ice bath and let cool for about 1 minute; discard water in Dutch oven.","Starting at X on base of each peach, use paring knife to remove strips of loosened skin. Cut each peach in half through stem and remove pit. Cut each half in half.","In now-empty Dutch oven, bring 3 cups water; sugar; and flavoring, if using, to boil over high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add peaches, return to boil, then immediately remove pot from heat. Let peaches sit in syrup for 3 minutes. Discard flavoring, if using.","Meanwhile, spread dish towel on counter. Using jar lifter, remove jars from canning pot and drain water back into pot. Place jars upside down on towel to drain briefly.","While peaches are hot, use canning funnel and slotted spoon to gently pack peaches into jars. Ladle hot syrup over peaches to cover, leaving 1 inch headspace at tops of jars. Slide wooden skewer along inside of jars, pressing slightly against peaches to remove air bubbles. Add extra syrup as needed.","Wipe mouths of jars clean. Place lids on jars, then screw on rings until fingertip-tight; do not overtighten. Using jar lifter, lower jars into water in canning pot, making sure they are covered by at least 1 inch water (add water if necessary). Cover pot and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, start timer and cook for 20 minutes.","Turn off heat and let jars sit in pot for 5 minutes. Remove jars from pot using jar lifter and let cool at room temperature for 24 hours to seal properly.","After 24 hours, check to make sure lids have sealed to jars; they should not be able to be depressed with your finger. Remove jar rings; clean rims with damp cloth; and replace rings, if desired. Jars that did not seal properly can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Properly sealed jars can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 year."]

notes: "Yellow peaches are a must here; white peaches, which do not have enough natural acidity, are not a safe substitute in this recipe. In step 4, you can peel firmer peaches with a serrated vegetable peeler. The cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla bean are optional ingredients that can be added in step 5; choose one if you prefer flavored peaches. If using a flavoring, be sure to remove it before jarring the peaches. In step 7, its important to pack the peaches into the jars while theyre hot. We suggest reading this recipe all the way through before beginning. This recipe can easily be doubled; depending on the size of your pots, you may have to cook everything in two batches."
