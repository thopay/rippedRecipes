serves: 4
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Trim outer leaves of cauliflower and cut stem flush with bottom of head. Flip cauliflower so stem is facing up. Using kitchen shears, cut stems vertically around core to remove large florets. Cut florets through stem into 1-inch pieces.","Using knife, square off sides of core; discard scraps. Cut trimmed core into ½-inch pieces. (You should have about 7 cups cauliflower total.) Combine 1 teaspoon oil, thyme, and garlic in small bowl; set aside.","Heat remaining ¼ cup oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add cauliflower, sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt and ⅛ teaspoon pepper, and stir to combine. Spread cauliflower into even layer. Cook until cauliflower is evenly browned, about 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.","Continue to cook until cauliflower is tender and dark brown in spots, 8 to 10 minutes longer, stirring gently and redistributing cauliflower into even layer every 1 to 2 minutes as needed. (Cauliflower should be dark brown, but if it starts to burn, reduce heat slightly.)","Push cauliflower to sides of skillet. Add thyme mixture to center and cook, stirring with rubber spatula, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Off heat, stir thyme mixture into cauliflower. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to platter. Serve with lemon wedges."]

notes: "Kitchen shears make easy work of cutting the cauliflower florets away from the core, but you can use a paring knife if you prefer. The cauliflower pieces will not fit in an even layer in the skillet at the start of cooking in step 3. As the pieces cook, they will shrink so that all of them will be in contact with the skillet bottom."
