Scoop 2 cups ice cream into medium bowl and mash with wooden spoon until softened. Stir in peanuts until combined. Add ¼ cup caramel mixture and fold until swirled into ice cream. Scrape into plastic-lined bowl and smooth top. Wrap with plastic and freeze until firm, about 6 hours.","TO ASSEMBLE: Line 10-cup bowl with plastic, letting ends of plastic overhang bowl by several inches. Scoop remaining 4 cups ice cream into medium bowl and mash with wooden spoon until softened. Scrape softened ice cream into plastic-lined 10-cup bowl. Working quickly, unwrap caramel-swirled ice cream, discard plastic, and press, round side down, into softened ice cream until flush with level of ice cream. Place cake round over top, trimming sides as necessary so cake fits inside bowl. Wrap with plastic and freeze until completely firm, about 6 hours.","TO SERVE: When ready to serve, unmold and discard plastic. Place cake side down on plate or pedestal. Drizzle remaining caramel mixture over top, then mound Cracker Jack in center. Serve immediately."]
