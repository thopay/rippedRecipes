serves: 4
time: "35 minutes"
instructions: ["Pat ham dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Cook bacon in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from skillet (leaving bacon fat behind) and reserve for another use. Add ham to skillet with bacon fat and cook until well browned on first side, about 5 minutes. Flip ham and cook on second side until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer ham to platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil.","Add onion to now-empty skillet and cook until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and cook for 15 seconds. Whisk in broth and maple syrup, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to simmer and cook until mixture is reduced to Â¾ cup and slightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes.","Off heat, whisk in butter and espresso powder. Season with pepper to taste. Discard any juices on ham platter. Carve ham steak into 4 equal portions. Pour red-eye gravy over ham. Serve."]
nutrition: undefined
notes: "Pat the ham steak dry before cooking so it will brown well. Before pouring the gravy over the ham in step 3, discard any accumulated juices on the platter, as they will make the sauce too salty."
