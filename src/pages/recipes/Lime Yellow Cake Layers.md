ingredients: ["3 3/4 cups (15 ounces), cake flour","2 2/3 cups (18⅔ ounces), sugar, divided","1 3/4 teaspoons, baking powder","1/2 teaspoon, baking soda","1 teaspoon, table salt","1 1/2 cups, buttermilk, room temperature","15 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly","9 , large egg yolks plus 5 large whites, room temperature, divided","1/4 cup, vegetable oil","3 tablespoons lime, zest plus 6 tablespoons juice (3 limes)","1 tablespoon, vanilla extract"]
serves: 12
time: "1¾ hours, plus 1½ hours cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Whisk flour, 2⅓ cups sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, melted butter, egg yolks, oil, lime zest and juice, and vanilla together in 4-cup liquid measuring cup or medium bowl.","Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip egg whites on medium-high speed until foamy, about 45 seconds. Gradually add remaining ⅓ cup sugar; continue to whip until stiff peaks just form, 2 to 3 minutes longer (whites should hold peaks, but mixture should appear moist). Transfer egg white mixture to bowl and set aside.","Transfer flour mixture to clean, dry mixer bowl and fit mixer with clean, dry whisk attachment. With mixer running on low speed, gradually pour in buttermilk mixture and mix until almost incorporated and some streaks of dry flour remain, about 15 seconds. Stop mixer and scrape down bowl and whisk attachment. Mix on medium-low speed until smooth and fully combined, 10 to 15 seconds.","Using rubber spatula, stir one-third of egg white mixture into batter to lighten, then gently fold in remaining egg white mixture until no white streaks remain. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans. Gently tap pans on counter several times to release air bubbles.","Bake until cakes begin to pull away from sides of pans and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 40 to 44 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Loosen cakes from sides of pans with paring knife, then invert onto greased wire rack and discard parchment. Invert cakes again and let cool completely on rack, about 1½ hours."]
