notes: "If you cant find Sichuan chili flakes, you can substitute gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes). Alternatively, you can substitute red pepper flakes, but the nuts will be spicier and less aromatic. Sichuan peppercorns provide a unique tingly, numbing sensation thats important here; find them in the spice aisle at Asian markets or online. If youre spice-averse or sensitive to the numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorns, use less chili flakes and peppercorns. To seed the whole dried Sichuan chiles, snip off the stems with kitchen shears and scrape out the seeds with a toothpick. You can also use kitchen shears to slice the chiles."
