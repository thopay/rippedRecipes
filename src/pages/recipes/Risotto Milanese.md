serves: 6
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Bring broth to boil in large saucepan over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Add saffron and cover to keep warm.","Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until edges of grains are translucent, about 2 minutes.","Add wine and cook, stirring frequently, until wine is nearly absorbed, about 1 minute. Stir in 4 cups warm broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring every 5 minutes until nearly all liquid has been absorbed and rice is just al dente, 15 to 19 minutes.","Add remaining 1 cup warm broth and cook, stirring constantly, until grains of rice are cooked through but still slightly firm in center and cooking liquid is thick and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan. Let risotto stand off heat, covered, for 5 minutes.","Stir in remaining 5 tablespoons butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust consistency with up to ½ cup warm broth as needed. (Texture of risotto should be somewhat loose; it will thicken slightly as it sits.) Serve."]

notes: "Gently crumbling the saffron makes it easier to achieve an accurate measurement. For a softer, creamier risotto, you can substitute carnaroli rice for the arborio. You can substitute 1 tablespoon of kosher salt for the table salt, if desired. This risotto is the perfect accompaniment for our Ossobuco in Bianco."
