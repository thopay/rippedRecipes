Brush ham evenly with glaze and let sit for 5 minutes. Carve and serve."]

notes: "Do not substitute spiral-cut ham, as it dries out during slow cooking. Let the glaze cool for 5 minutes before applying (it should be just warm to the touch). For a hint of spiciness, add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne to the sugar mixture at the beginning of step 2."
