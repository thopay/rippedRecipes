Transfer milk mixture to clean bowl and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.","MAKE FROSTING With stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat cooled milk mixture and vanilla on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Let sit at room temperature until stiff, about 1 hour.","MAKE AHEAD: Frosting can be refrigerated in airtight container for 1 week. When ready to use, let stand at room temperature until softened, about 2 hours. Beat with stand mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute."]

notes: "Whole milk makes the richest, tastiest frosting. Use a stand mixer; the frosting is too thick for a hand mixer. And plan ahead, as the frosting needs time to cool."
