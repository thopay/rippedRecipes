notes: "Eight ounces of rhubarb is two to three stalks. Choose stalks that are ¾ to 1 inch thick. Depending on the style of your jar, you may have extra brine. The important thing is to make sure that the rhubarb is fully submerged. Serve the pickles on a charcuterie or cheese platter, in a salad or grain bowl, or as a chopped relish on a sandwich, or eat them straight out of the jar."
