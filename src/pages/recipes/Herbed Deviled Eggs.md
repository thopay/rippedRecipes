instructions: ["Cook eggs: Combine 4 cups water and 4 cups ice cubes in large bowl; set aside. Place eggs in saucepan, cover with 1 inch water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let stand 10 minutes. Pour off water from saucepan and gently shake pan back and forth to crack egg shells. Transfer eggs to ice water and cool 5 minutes.","Make filling: Peel eggs and halve lengthwise. Transfer yolks to fine-mesh sieve set over medium bowl. Using spatula, press yolks through sieve into bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients until smooth.","Fill: Arrange whites on serving platter. Divide yolk mixture among whites. Serve.

notes: "You can use reduced-fat mayonnaise and sour cream in this recipe. To fill the eggs, a spoon works just fine, but for eggs that look their Sunday best, use a pastry bag fitted with a fluted (star) tip or make your own pastry bag (see related testing). You can substitute an equal amount of finely chopped watercress for chervil."
