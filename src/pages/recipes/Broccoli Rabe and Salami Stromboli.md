instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease foil. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broccoli rabe and water, cover, and cook until just tender, about 1 minute. Uncover and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute longer. Transfer broccoli rabe to dish towel; gather corners of towel and squeeze out excess moisture.","Roll dough into 12 by 10-inch rectangle on lightly floured counter with long side parallel to counter edge. Shingle provolone evenly over dough, leaving 1/2-inch border along top and sides. Layer salami over provolone. Sprinkle mozzarella and broccoli rabe evenly over salami.","Brush borders with egg (reserve remaining egg for brushing top of stromboli). Fold bottom third of stromboli in toward middle. Fold top third of stromboli down to cover first fold, creating log. Pinch seam firmly to seal. Transfer stromboli to prepared sheet, seam side down. Pinch ends firmly to seal and tuck underneath. Loosely cover stromboli with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour.","Brush top of stromboli with remaining egg. Using sharp knife, make 5 evenly spaced 1/2-inch-deep slashes, 2 inches long, on top of stromboli. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake until crust is golden and center registers 200 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer stromboli to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to cutting board and cut into 2-inch-thick slices. Serve."]
