ingredients: ["1/4 cup, soy sauce","3 tablespoons, cider vinegar","3 tablespoons, toasted sesame oil","1 tablespoon, mayonnaise","1 teaspoon, dry mustard","1 teaspoon, sugar","1 tablespoon, sugar","1 tablespoon, kosher salt","2 teaspoons, pepper","4 (8- to 12-ounce) skinless yellowfin, tuna steaks, 1 inch thick","1 tablespoon, vegetable oil, plus extra for oiling grill"]
serves: 6
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["FOR THE VINAIGRETTE: Combine all ingredients in 8-ounce Mason jar. Affix lid and shake vigorously until emulsified, about 10 seconds. Set aside.","FOR THE TUNA: Combine sugar, salt, and pepper in bowl. Pat tuna dry with paper towels and place on large plate. Brush tuna with oil on both sides. Sprinkle each steak with 1 teaspoon sugar mixture on each side.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.","Scrape cooking grate clean with grill brush. Fold dish towel into compact wad. Holding towel with tongs, dip in oil, then wipe grate. Dip towel in oil again and wipe grate again. Cover grill and heat to 500 degrees, about 5 minutes. Uncover and wipe grate twice more with oiled towel.","Place tuna on grill (over hotter side if using charcoal) and cook, uncovered and without moving tuna, for 2 minutes.","Using fish spatula, gently flip tuna and continue to cook, uncovered, for 2 minutes longer for rare. (Alternatively, cook for 2½ minutes per side for medium-rare, 3 minutes per side for medium, or 4 minutes per side for medium-well.) Transfer tuna to carving board and immediately slice ¼ inch thick. Shake vinaigrette to re-emulsify, if necessary. Serve tuna with vinaigrette."]

notes: "We intentionally omitted internal cooking temperatures for the tuna in this recipe because we found it hard to get a consistent reading without overcooking some of the fish. Instead, pay attention to the times in the recipe to achieve your desired doneness. We strongly suggest cooking the tuna to rare or medium-rare. Have everything ready before you start; the tuna cooks very quickly. Our&nbsp;Pickled Ginger is a great accompaniment to this tuna."
