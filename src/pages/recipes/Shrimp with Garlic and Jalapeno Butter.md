instructions: ["Combine 2 quarts cold water, ¼ cup salt, and baking soda in large bowl and whisk until salt is dissolved. Add shrimp and let soak for 20 minutes. Combine fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and pepper in small bowl; set aside.","Transfer shrimp to colander and rinse well with cold water. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels and transfer to large mixing bowl. Sprinkle ⅓ cup potato starch over shrimp and toss to coat. Add remaining ⅓ cup potato starch and toss until shrimp are well coated. Transfer shrimp to rimmed baking sheet, shaking off any excess starch.","Line large mixing bowl with paper towels. Add oil to 12-inch skillet until it measures about ¾ inch deep. Heat oil over medium-high heat to 400 degrees. Add half of shrimp to skillet, spacing them so they don't touch. Fry until lightly golden and crisp, 60 to 90 seconds per side.","Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer fried shrimp to prepared bowl. (Exterior of shrimp should be crisp when tapped. If not, return shrimp to oil and fry for another 15 seconds on both sides.) Repeat with remaining shrimp.","Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add scallion whites and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add jalapenos and fish sauce mixture and cook, stirring often, until sugar is melted and sauce just comes to boil, about 30 seconds.","Remove paper towels from bowl with shrimp. Pour sauce over shrimp and sprinkle with scallion greens. Toss until shrimp are evenly coated in sauce. Transfer to serving platter. Serve."]

notes: "We prefer untreated shrimp—those not treated with sodium or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP). Most frozen E-Z peel shrimp have been treated (the ingredient list should tell you). Serve with rice and sliced cucumber."
