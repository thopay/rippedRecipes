instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Combine water, polenta, salt, and pepper in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Transfer dish to oven and bake, uncovered, until water is absorbed and polenta has thickened, about 60 minutes.","After 45 minutes, heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add mushrooms and cook until liquid is released and mushrooms begin to brown, 5 to 8 minutes, adjusting heat to ensure that shallot and garlic don’t burn. Add wine and cook until reduced to syrup, about 1 minute. Add broth and cook until reduced to 1/3 cup, 3 to 5 minutes.

notes: "You can use medium-grind cornmeal in place of the polenta; they are different names for the same thing. Don’t use instant polenta, however. You can substitute 1½ pounds of any fresh, wild mushrooms, such as oyster, for the white mushrooms (wild mushrooms tend to have more waste when trimming than white mushrooms)."
