Repeat with remaining chicken.","Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add bell pepper and onion and cook until vegetables are spotty brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice, water, ¾ cup coconut-ginger sauce, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Nestle chicken into rice mixture skin side up. Cover; transfer to oven; and bake until chicken registers at least 185 degrees, about 25 minutes.","Transfer pot to wire rack and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes.
