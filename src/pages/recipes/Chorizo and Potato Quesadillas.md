Transfer to bowl and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.","Stir Monterey Jack and cilantro into chorizo mixture. Spread 1 cup chorizo mixture over half of each tortilla, leaving ½-inch border. Fold tortillas over filling and press firmly so quesadillas stay folded.","Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place 2 folded quesadillas in skillet, weigh down with large saucepan, and cook until browned and cheese has melted, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to cutting board.
