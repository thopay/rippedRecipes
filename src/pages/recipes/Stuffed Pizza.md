serves: 8
time: "1¾ hours, plus 45 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE PIZZA: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Cook sausage in 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl and let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Add pepperoni, ham, salami, and ½ teaspoon oregano to bowl with sausage and toss to combine.","Turn out 1 dough ball onto lightly floured 16 by 12-inch sheet parchment paper. Using your hands, flatten into 8-inch disk. Using rolling pin, roll dough into 12-inch circle, dusting lightly with flour as needed.","Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella evenly over dough, leaving ½-inch border. Sprinkle one-third of sausage mixture (about 1 heaping cup) over cheese. Repeat layering until cheese and meat mixture are used up (top layer should be cheese).","Roll remaining dough ball into 12-inch circle on lightly floured counter, dusting lightly with flour as needed. Brush edges of dough on parchment with water. Loosely roll dough on counter around rolling pin and gently unroll it directly over dough on parchment and filling. Press dough edges together firmly to seal. Using pizza cutter, trim and discard dough just beyond sealed edge of pizza, about ¼ inch from filling.","Using paring knife, cut 1-inch hole in top center of pizza. Lifting parchment, transfer pizza to rimmed baking sheet. Using your hands, press down on top of pizza to compress filling into even layer. Bake until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.","Slide pizza from sheet onto wire rack. Microwave butter and garlic in small bowl until butter is melted and mixture is fragrant, about 1 minute. Brush top of hot pizza with garlic butter, then sprinkle with remaining ¼ teaspoon oregano. Let pizza cool on rack for at least 45 minutes. (Cooled pizza can be covered loosely with aluminum foil and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to serving dish. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)","To serve, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Slice pizza into 8 wedges and place on parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake pizza slices until hot throughout, about 10 minutes. Microwave sauce until hot, about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve pizza with sauce."]

notes: "Plan ahead: Once baked, this pizza needs to rest for at least 45 minutes so that it can be sliced cleanly without the filling oozing out. Do not use canned pizza dough such as Pillsbury Pizza Crust here. When using store-bought pizza dough, it is helpful to let it come to room temperature to make it easier to roll out and shape. Buy a 4-ounce chunk of salami rather than sliced salami from the deli."
