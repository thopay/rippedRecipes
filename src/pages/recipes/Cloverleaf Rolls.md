serves: 12
time: "2 hours, plus 1 hour rising"
instructions: ["WARM OVEN Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. Grease large bowl.","MAKE DOUGH Whisk milk, sugar, and yeast in liquid measuring cup until yeast dissolves, then whisk in egg and yolk. In bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour and salt until combined. With mixer on low, add milk mixture in steady stream and mix until dough begins to form, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium and add softened butter, 1 piece at a time, until incorporated. Continue to mix until dough is smooth and comes away from sides of bowl, about 10 minutes.","LET RISE Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead briefly to form smooth, cohesive ball. Transfer dough to prepared bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and place in turned-off oven until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes.","SHAPE ROLLS Brush 12-cup muffin tin with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Punch down dough on lightly floured work surface. Following photos 1 to 3 (at left), divide dough into thirds and roll each third into 18-inch-long rope. Cut each rope into 12 equal pieces and cover with plastic. On clean surface, roll each piece into smooth ball. Place 3 balls, seam side down, in each muffin cup. Cover loosely with plastic and let rest in turned-off oven until doubled in size, about 20 minutes.","BAKE Remove rolls from oven and discard plastic. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes, rotating tin halfway through baking. Brush rolls with remaining melted butter. Cool in tin 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Serve warm.","MAKE AHEAD: Filled muffin tin can be refrigerated, covered, for 24 hours. Let dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before baking."]

notes: "This dough will be a little sticky; resist the urge to add more flour. Also, roll the dough into balls on a dry, unfloured work surface."
