notes: "For recipes that use fresh orange segments, its important to remove the bitter pith and membranes. In the test kitchen, we use a paring knife to cut away the peel and white pith. Then we remove just the fruit flesh by cutting to the center inside the two membranes of each section. Use this recipe as an accompaniment to grilled meat or fish."
