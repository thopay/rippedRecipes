instructions: ["Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add prosciutto and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes, flipping occasionally. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate and let cool slightly. Break into large pieces; set aside. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons oil and garlic in now-empty skillet and cook over medium-low heat until pale golden, about 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in pepper flakes.","Meanwhile, bring 3 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until pasta is pliable but still firm, about 6 minutes. Reserve 3 cups cooking water, then drain pasta.","Combine pasta, salt, garlic mixture, and 2 cups reserved cooking water in now-empty pot and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until water is mostly absorbed but still pools slightly in bottom of pot, about 5 minutes. Stir in beans and tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 30 seconds. Let pasta sit off heat for 2 minutes. Adjust consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed. Season with salt to taste. Add arugula and stir until it just starts to wilt, about 15 seconds. Serve, topping individual portions with prosciutto."]
