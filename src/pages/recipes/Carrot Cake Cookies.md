serves: 24
time: "1 hour, plus 30 minutes macerating and 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["FOR THE COOKIES: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine carrots, 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in bowl and let sit for 30 minutes. Place carrots in center of clean dish towel, gather ends of towel to form bundle, and twist to remove as much moisture from carrots as possible (you should squeeze off about 1/4 cup liquid).","Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in bowl. Whisk brown sugar, melted butter, egg and yolk, vanilla, and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in separate large bowl until fully combined. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined. Stir in carrots, 1 cup walnuts, and raisins.","Drop 2-tablespoon portions of dough onto prepared sheets, staggering 12 portions per sheet. (Distribute any remaining dough evenly.) Using your fingers, lightly press cookies to even 3/4-inch thickness. Bake cookies until edges are set and beginning to brown, 16 to 20 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely before frosting.","FOR THE FROSTING: Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add cream cheese, 1 piece at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Add vanilla and mix until no lumps remain.","Spread about 1 tablespoon frosting over each cooled cookie and sprinkle cookies with remaining 3/4 cup walnuts. Serve. (Cookies can be layered between sheets of parchment paper and stored in airtight container for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "Grate the carrots using the shredding disk of a food processor or on the large holes of a box grater (the Rosle Coarse Grater is our favorite). Do not use packaged preshredded carrots."
