instructions: ["Adjust rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 standard muffin tins with cupcake liners.","Whisk boiling water, cocoa, chocolate, and espresso powder together in small bowl. Whisk eggs, sour cream, and vanilla together in medium bowl until well combined.","With electric mixer on low speed, combine flour, baking soda, salt, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in large bowl until blended. Add butter and mix on low until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add egg mixture in 2 additions, then beat at medium speed, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until combined, about 1 minute.","Add chocolate mixture and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 1 minute. Divide batter evenly among 24 cupcake liners. Bake until skewer or toothpick inserted in cupcake comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes in muffin tins for 10 minutes before removing and cooling completely on wire rack. Frost, using one of the related recipes.","To Make Ahead: Unfrosted cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. (They also can be individually wrapped in plastic and frozen in a zipper-lock bag for up to 1 month.) The frostings can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. Once frosted, the cupcakes are best eaten within a day, but leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for several days."]
