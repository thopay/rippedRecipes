serves: 12
time: "3 to 4 hours, plus 45 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Combine five-spice powder, 2 teaspoons salt, cumin, 1 teaspoon pepper, granulated garlic, cayenne, and cardamom in bowl. Combine 1 tablespoon spice mixture with softened butter and sugar in second bowl. Combine 1 tablespoon spice mixture with oil in third bowl.","Dry turkey thoroughly inside and out with paper towels. With turkey breast side up on work surface, use your fingers or handle of wooden spoon to carefully separate skin from breast. Rub spiced butter evenly under skin of breast. Tuck wings underneath turkey and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Rub spiced oil evenly over entire surface of turkey. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in foil packet and cut several vent holes in top.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely and place disposable pan filled with 3 cups water on 1 side of grill, with long side of pan facing center of grill. Arrange 3 quarts unlit charcoal briquettes in even layer on opposite side of grill. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4½ quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over unlit coals. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Place disposable pie plates with 2 cups water in each directly on secondary burner(s). Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner as needed to maintain grill temperature of 325 degrees.)","Clean and oil cooking grate. Place turkey, breast side up, over pan(s), with legs pointing toward fire for charcoal grill or with 1 side of turkey facing primary burner for gas. Cover (placing lid vent over turkey on charcoal grill) and cook for 1 hour.","Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining 2 teaspoons spice mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. After turkey has been on grill for 1 hour, brush all over with spiced butter, rotating turkey if using gas grill (if turkey looks too dark, cover breast lightly with foil). Cover and continue to cook until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs/drumsticks register 175 degrees, 1 to 2 hours longer.","Transfer turkey to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Carve turkey and serve."]

notes: "We prefer a Butterball turkey for this recipe. If you prefer natural, unenhanced turkey, we recommend brining: Dissolve 1 cup of salt in 2 gallons of cold water; submerge the turkey in the brine, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours. Make sure you have plenty of fuel if you’re using a gas grill."
