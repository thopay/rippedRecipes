serves: 6
time: ""
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Stir honey and cayenne together in measuring cup. Tie roast at even intervals with 5 pieces of butcher's twine. Rub roast with salt and pepper.","Heat oil in heavy-bottomed, ovenproof 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place roast fat-side down in skillet and cook until well browned, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, rotate roast one-quarter turn and cook until well browned, about 2 1/2 minutes. Repeat two more times until roast is well browned on all sides. Pour off fat from skillet. Add honey mixture and cook for 30 seconds, using tongs to turn roast and coat it with glaze.","Place skillet in oven and cook until center of roast registers about 135 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer roast to carving board and let rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile, set skillet over high heat and boil until glaze reduces to 1/3 cup, about 1 minute. Once reduced to this amount, leave glaze in measuring cup. When ready to carve roast (center should register about 150 degrees on instant-read thermometer), snip off twine and pour glaze over meat. Cut into 1/4-inch slices and serve immediately."]

notes: "This recipe starts on the stovetop and finishes in the oven, so you will need an ovenproof skillet. Remember that the handle will be blistering hot when you take it out of the oven, so be sure to use a potholder or an oven mitt."
