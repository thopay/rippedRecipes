description: "Ready in just 20 minutes, fettuccine Alfredo is perfect for weeknight cooking, but such a heavy dish is usually consigned to the occasional restaurant indulgence. We wanted to eliminate all the cream and most of the butter, and still have a pasta dish worth eating."

notes: "Make the sauce while the pasta water  is heating up. Once the sauce is done, you should be ready to cook the pasta. Fresh pasta is more porous than dried, and we recommend it here because it will better absorb the sauce."
