notes: "Our winning nonstick skillet is the OXO Good Grips Non-Stick 12-inch Open Frypan. To protect the skillets silicone handle while its in the oven, wrap it in a double layer of wet paper towels and then cover the towels with a double layer of aluminum foil before starting to cook. Good-quality Parmesan cheese makes a difference here."
