serves: 6
time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Brush rimmed baking sheet with oil.","Combine provolone, mozzarella, jalapenos, cilantro, and scallions in bowl. Fold tortillas in half. Arrange folded tortillas in single layer on prepared sheet with rounded edges facing center of sheet.","Bake until tortilla tops and edges begin to turn spotty brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pan from oven. Flip tortillas over. Using tongs, open each tortilla and fill each with equal amount of cheese mixture (about 1 cup each), leaving 1-inch border. Close tortillas and press firmly with spatula to compact.","Return quesadillas to oven and continue to bake until crisp around edges and golden brown on second side, 4 to 6 minutes longer.

notes: "Cooling the quesadillas before cutting is important; straight from the oven the cheese is molten and will ooze out. Shred the cheese on the large holes of a box grater. Serve the quesadillas with pico de gallo, guacamole, or sour cream."
