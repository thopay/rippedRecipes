serves: 4
time: "1 hour 10 minutes, plus 24 hours marinating"
instructions: ["Combine sugar and soy sauce in small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Let cool completely off heat.","Combine onion, pineapple and juice, kiwi, and garlic in blender and puree until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion mixture to 13 by 9-inch baking dish; stir in wine, oil, and soy sauce mixture until combined.","Line rimmed baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Rinse ribs under cold running water to remove any bone fragments, then transfer to prepared sheet. Pat tops of ribs dry with additional paper towels.","Working with a few ribs at a time, transfer ribs to marinade, turn gently to coat, and submerge in marinade. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 2 days.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4½ quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium.","Clean and oil cooking grate. Grill ribs, uncovered, until evenly browned on first side, about 6 minutes, moving ribs as needed for even cooking and to prevent flare-ups. Flip ribs and continue to grill until evenly browned on second side, about 6 minutes longer. Transfer ribs to platter, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "We call for clear rice wine here; michiu, cheongju, or mirin can be used. This recipe can easily be doubled to accommodate a larger group (you will need to marinate the ribs in two separate dishes, and you may need more charcoal if using a charcoal grill). We dont typically wash our proteins before cooking, but flanken-style short ribs tend to have a fair amount of bone fragments stuck to them because they are cut with a band saw. Rinsing is necessary to remove those fragments. A small, 8-ounce can of pineapple chunks will yield enough for this recipe. Some grocery stores sell yellow kiwi; the flavor of green kiwi is preferred here. Garnish the kalbi with sliced scallions, if desired."
