notes: "Orange juice concentrate is relatively soft even when its frozen, so theres no need to defrost the whole container to get what you need. Remove the strips of zest from the orange with a vegetable peeler. Cider vinegar can be substituted for the distilled white vinegar, if desired. These tacos are best served with sliced radishes, avocado chunks, cotija cheese, fresh cilantro, hot sauce, and lime wedges. Theyre also great with pickled onions."
