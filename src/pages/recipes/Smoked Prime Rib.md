instructions: ["FOR THE PRIME RIB: Using sharp knife, cut 1-inch crosshatch pattern in fat cap of roast, being careful not to cut into meat. Rub salt and pepper over entire roast and into crosshatch. Transfer to large plate and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 24 hours or up to 4 days.","Open bottom vent of charcoal grill completely. Arrange 40 charcoal briquettes, 2 briquettes wide, around half of perimeter of grill, overlapping slightly so briquettes are touching, to form C shape. Place second layer of 40 briquettes, also 2 briquettes wide, on top of first. (Completed arrangement should be 2 briquettes wide by 2 briquettes high.)","Place 2 wood chunks on top of charcoal 2 inches from each end of C. Place remaining chunk in center of C. Place disposable pan in center of grill, running lengthwise into arc of C. Pour 6 cups water into disposable pan.","Light chimney starter filled with 10 briquettes (pile briquettes on 1 side of chimney so they catch). When coals are partially covered with ash, use tongs to place them at 1 end of C.","Set cooking grate in place, then clean and oil grate. Place roast over water pan, fat side up, with bones facing arc in C. Insert temperature probe into center of roast. Cover grill, open lid vent completely, and position lid vent over roast. Cook until meat registers 115 degrees (for medium-rare), 2½ to 3¼ hours.","FOR THE HORSERADISH SAUCE: Meanwhile, combine all ingredients in bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","Transfer roast to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 45 minutes. Carve meat from bones and slice ¾ inch thick. Serve with sauce. (Leftover meat can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)"]

notes: "We developed this recipe using a 22-inch Weber kettle charcoal grill. If you intend to make the Smoked Prime Rib Sandwiches with Green Chile Queso, reserve a 12-ounce chunk of meat after carving the roast in step 7. Be sure to also reserve 3 tablespoons of the horseradish sauce."
