serves: 4
time: "30 minutes"
instructions: ["Divide pork into 4 equal balls. Flatten balls into even ¾-inch-thick patties. Using your fingertips, press down center of each patty until about ½ inch thick, creating slight divot. Sprinkle patties with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Combine coleslaw mix, mayonnaise, maple syrup, vinegar, mustard, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon pepper in bowl; set aside.","Cook bacon in 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, about 6 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate; once cooled, break slices in half. Add patties to now-empty skillet and cook until well browned on both sides and meat registers 160 degrees, about 10 minutes. Top burgers with cheddar, transfer to large plate, and let rest for 3 minutes. Place burgers on bun bottoms and top with slaw and bacon, then add bun tops. Serve."]
