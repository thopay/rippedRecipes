instructions: ["FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 9-inch pie plate with vegetable oil spray. Process breadsticks and sugar in food processor to fine crumbs, about 30 seconds. Add butter and cream cheese and pulse until combined, about 8 pulses. Using bottom of dry measuring cup, press crumbs into bottom and up sides of pie plate. Bake until crust is fragrant and beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating plate halfway through baking. Let crust cool completely on wire rack, about 30 minutes.","FOR THE FILLING: Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup milk in small bowl and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Whisk cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until smooth. Combine chocolate and remaining 1/4 cup milk in medium bowl and microwave at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 90 seconds. Microwave gelatin mixture until melted, about 10 seconds. Stir gelatin mixture into chocolate mixture. Whisk chocolate mixture into cream cheese mixture until smooth.","Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently fold whipped egg whites into chocolate mixture in 2 additions until no white streaks remain. Pour filling into crust. Refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours. Serve."]

notes: "Purchase cracker-style breadsticks for the crust, not the soft, freshly baked variety."
