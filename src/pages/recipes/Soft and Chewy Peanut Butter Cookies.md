instructions: ["MAKE DOUGH Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Whisk peanut butter, brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, granulated sugar, egg, yolk, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture until just combined. Divide dough in half, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.","SHAPE cookies Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll 2 tablespoons chilled dough into 1½-inch balls and place 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Using greased measuring cup, gently press each ball to ¾-inch thickness and top with chopped peanuts, pressing lightly to adhere.","BAKE AND COOL Bake cookies until puffed and edges are lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Cool 5 minutes on sheets, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough. Serve. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container for 3 days.)"]

notes: "Use processed peanut butter for the softest, chewiest texture. The dough is quite soft, so keep it chilled until you are ready to form and bake the cookies."
