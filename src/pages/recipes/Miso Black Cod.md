notes: "Black cod (also known as sablefish) is increasingly available in fish markets and supermarkets across the country. For the freshest possible fish, ask your fishmonger if you can purchase the black cod still frozen. Thaw the frozen fillets overnight in the refrigerator. Black cod often contains a row of small pin bones running down the center line of the fillet; they are difficult to remove from the raw fillets but slide out easily once the fillets are cooked. Its also easy to cut on either side of the center line of the cooked fillets to avoid them. Salmon (either farmed or wild), Chilean sea bass, or arctic char can be substituted for the black cod. If using wild salmon or arctic char, cook the fillets to 120 degrees (for medium-rare), and start checking for doneness early. Red miso can be substituted for the white miso. Garnish with scallions, if desired."
