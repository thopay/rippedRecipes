instructions: ["FOR THE CRUST: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 9-inch pie plate with vegetable oil spray. Process graham crackers and sugar in food processor to fine crumbs, about 10 seconds. Add butter and neufchatel and pulse until combined, about 8 pulses. Press crumbs into bottom and up sides of prepared pie plate. Bake until top edge is slightly lighter in color and crust is set, about 15 minutes. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.","FOR THE PUDDING: Combine sugar, cornstarch, cocoa, and salt in bowl. Beat milk and egg together in medium saucepan. Whisk sugar mixture into pan. Add chocolate and bring mixture to boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to low and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture becomes thick and glossy, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat, stir in vanilla, and strain through fine-mesh strainer. Pour pudding into cooled crust. Place plastic wrap directly on surface of pudding to prevent skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely cool, at least 3 hours.","FOR THE WHIPPED TOPPING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 3 ­minutes. Spread whipped topping evenly over pie. Serve."]
