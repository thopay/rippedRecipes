Using fork, poke bottom of dough 10 times.","Cover and cook over medium heat until bottom of crust is spotty brown, about 6 minutes, checking halfway through cooking and popping any air bubbles with fork. Remove from heat.","Spread sauce evenly over dough, leaving 1/2-inch border, then sprinkle with pepper flakes. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over top.

notes: "Letting the dough rest on the counter allows the gluten to relax and keeps the dough from shrinking. If you’re using an electric stove, heat the burner for 3 minutes on medium heat before starting to cook."
