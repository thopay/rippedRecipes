notes: "A cleaver is the best tool for hacking through the chicken legs. If you don’t have one, use the thick heel end of a heavy-bladed chef’s knife or leave the legs whole and double the simmering time. If you’re not making soup and don’t need meat, you can use any combination of chicken backs and/or wingtips in place of the legs."
