Add steaks and cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until meat registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer steaks to prepared rack, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.","FOR THE SAUCE: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat.

notes: "We do not recommend making this recipe with steaks thinner than 1 inch, but thicker steaks can be used. If using thicker steaks, just continue to cook them, flipping every 2 minutes, until they register 125 degrees (for medium-rare). Top sirloin steaks are commonly sold as larger steaks (about 1 pound each) that serve two people. If you can find only larger steaks, buy two steaks and cut them in half crosswise to make four steaks that are about 8 ounces each. Be sure to use unseasoned rice vinegar here, because seasoned rice vinegar has added salt and sugar. Miso is quite salty. We like our steaks deeply seasoned, but if you tend to like less salt, reduce the amount of salt on the steaks to compensate for the miso sauce."
