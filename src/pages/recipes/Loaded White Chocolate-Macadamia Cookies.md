instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in bowl.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat brown sugar, melted butter, and granulated sugar on medium speed until well combined, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl as needed. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds.","Reduce speed to low. Slowly add flour mixture and mix until mostly incorporated but some streaks of flour remain, about 30 seconds. Add macadamia nuts and chocolate and mix until evenly distributed throughout dough, about 30 seconds.","Divide dough into sixteen 2½-ounce portions, about ¼ cup each. Divide any remaining dough evenly among dough portions. Roll dough portions between your wet hands to make dough balls.","Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 8 balls per sheet. Using your hand, flatten dough balls to ¾-inch thickness.","Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until centers of cookies are puffed and still very blond, 8 to 10 minutes. (Cookies will seem underdone but will continue to bake as they cool.) Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Serve warm."]
