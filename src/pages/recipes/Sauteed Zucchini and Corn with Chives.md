notes: "Zucchini need a good squeeze to rid them of excess moisture. Look for smaller zucchini at the supermarket; they are much more flavorful and less watery than their larger counterparts. This recipe also works with frozen corn. Simply defrost the corn and add it during the last minute or two of cooking time."
