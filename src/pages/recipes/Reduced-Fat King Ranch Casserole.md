instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 450 degrees. Divide tortillas between 2 baking sheets and spray both sides lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake until brown and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking; cool slightly. Pulse 2 tortillas, garlic, chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in food processor until coarsely ground, about 12 pulses; set aside. Break remaining 8 tortillas into bite-size pieces.","Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions, jalapenos, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add tomatoes and their juice and cook until most of liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Add chicken, return to simmer, and cook until no longer pink, about 12 minutes.","Remove pot from heat and transfer chicken to plate. Add Colby Jack, neufchatel, and cilantro to pot and stir until cheese is melted. Once cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-size pieces and return to pot.","Scatter half of bite-size tortilla pieces in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Spoon half of filling evenly over tortillas. Scatter remaining bite-size tortillas over filling, then top with remaining filling. Sprinkle spiced, coarsely ground tortilla mixture evenly over top of casserole. Spray lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake on upper-middle oven rack until filling is bubbling and topping is brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Serve."]
