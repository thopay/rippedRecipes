notes: "Use a good-quality, relatively mild extra-virgin olive oil for the best results. You will need about two bunches of parsley to yield 3 ounces of parsley leaves. Its OK to use the tender, thin stems at the base of the parsley sprigs. This recipe yields enough to sauce 1 pound of pasta (see our recipe for Linguine with Pesto di Prezzemolo). This pesto is also good on crostini, in sandwiches, on fish, stirred into soup, or as a dip with crudites."
