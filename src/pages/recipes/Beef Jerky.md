ingredients: ["2 1/2 pounds, top sirloin steaks, about 1 inch thick, trimmed","1/2 cup, packed brown sugar","1/4 cup, soy sauce","2 tablespoons, red miso","2 tablespoons, kosher salt","4 teaspoons, pepper","2 teaspoons, granulated garlic"]
serves: 12
time: "4¼ hours, plus 12 hours marinating"
instructions: ["Slice steaks against grain ⅛ to ¼ inch thick (length of slices is unimportant). Whisk sugar, soy sauce, miso, salt, pepper, and granulated garlic together in medium bowl. Add beef and toss until thoroughly coated with marinade. Transfer beef mixture to 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 36 hours, turning bag occasionally.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions, turn on convection fan (if using convection oven), and heat oven to 175 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil, set wire racks in sheets, and spray racks with vegetable oil spray.","Arrange beef in single layer on prepared racks; it's OK if pieces touch or overlap slightly. Transfer to oven and cook for 1½ hours for convection oven or 2 hours for conventional oven.","Remove sheets from oven and flip beef pieces. Return sheets to oven, alternating placement on oven racks, and continue to cook until beef is dry to touch and darkened in color, about 2 hours longer. Let cool completely on wire racks. Serve. (Cooled jerky can be stored in zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)"]

notes: "Flat-iron steaks, chuck roast, flank steak, and brisket flat can also be used in this recipe. If you’re buying a roast, cut it into approximate 1-inch-thick steaks before slicing it thin. Trim away as much excess fat as possible. If you find it hard to slice the meat thin, freeze it for 30 minutes to firm it up. The miso boosts the flavor of the jerky and also gives the marinade viscosity so that it clings to the meat. This recipe works best with a convection oven; however, a conventional oven will also work. Just extend the second half of the cooking time slightly if the jerky doesn’t look dry at the end of cooking. If you’re using table salt, cut the amount in half.&nbsp;"
