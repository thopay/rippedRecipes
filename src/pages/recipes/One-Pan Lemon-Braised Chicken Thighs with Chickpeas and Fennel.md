Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.","Heat oil in ovensafe 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chicken, skin side down, until skin is crisped and well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate, skin side up.","Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet, then heat fat left in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add fennel, cut side down, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, covered, until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Add garlic, lemon zest, coriander, and pepper flakes and cook, uncovered, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

notes: "Only the skin side of the chicken is seared in step 2. Cooking the chicken to an internal temperature of 185 degrees renders the fat and melts the tough connective tissues into rich gelatin. Leave the core in the fennel so the wedges don’t fall apart. We prefer briny green olives like Manzanilla, Picholine, or Cerignola in this recipe; look for them in your grocery store’s salad bar section or in the pickle aisle."
