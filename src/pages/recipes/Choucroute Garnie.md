Remove pot from oven and let rest, covered, for 20 minutes.","Transfer sauerkraut to shallow platter; place sausages on top. Discard thyme sprigs. Slice pork belly thin crosswise and add to platter.

notes: "Note that we call for fully cooked bratwurst here. We developed this recipe with 12 ounces of bratwurst and 14 ounces of kielbasa, but if you can find only slightly larger packages of these sausages, it’s OK to use the whole package. You can substitute two 8- to 10-ounce bone-in blade-cut pork chops; 1 pound of boneless pork butt, cut in half; or 1 pound of slab bacon for the pork belly. Serve with Boiled Potatoes with Butter and Parsley, if desired."
