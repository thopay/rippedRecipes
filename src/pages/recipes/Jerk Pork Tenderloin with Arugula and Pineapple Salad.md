Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook pork until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes; transfer pork to prepared wire rack. Roast until meat registers 140 degrees, about 15 minutes. Transfer to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.","Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pineapple, onion, orange juice, cayenne, and remaining 1 tablespoon jerk seasoning and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until onion is just softened, about 3 minutes. Off heat, stir in arugula. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice pork, transfer to platter, and top with pineapple mixture."]

notes: "Buy tenderloins that are of equal size and weight so that they cook at the same rate; make sure that they are no larger than 12 ounces, as bigger tenderloins wonâ€™t fit in the skillet together."
