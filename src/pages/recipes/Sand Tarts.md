description: "These once-popular cinnamon-sugar cookies are now mostly forgotten-maybe because the dough is so hard to work with. We wanted to resurrect these thin, crisp, buttery cookies with an easier recipe."

instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Process flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and salt in food processor until combined. Add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until just incorporated. Add egg and yolk and pulse until soft dough forms.","Wrap dough in plastic wrap and flatten into 1-inch-thick disk. Transfer to freezer until firm, about 15 minutes. Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar in small bowl. Break disk of chilled dough into 2 pieces and return 1 piece to freezer. Working with your floured hands, take 1 1/2 tablespoons chilled dough and roll into 1 1/2-inch ball, and then roll in cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat. Place balls 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Press balls into 2 1/2-inch disks with greased measuring cup, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and garnish with almonds.","Bake cookies until edges are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool 5 minutes on sheets, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely. Repeat rolling, shaping, and garnishing process with remaining dough and bake as directed. Serve. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for 3 days.)"]
