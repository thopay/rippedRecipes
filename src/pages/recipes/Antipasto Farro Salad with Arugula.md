notes: "We developed this recipe using Bob’s Red Mill Organic Farro. You can also use whole-grain or semipearled farro here if you can find it, but note that the cooking time will be on the longer side of the range given. To use whole-grain farro, soak it for at least 8 hours or up to 12 hours and drain it thoroughly before starting with step 1. Do not use quick-cooking farro here. To cut the cooling time in step 3 in half, you can spread the farro over a rimmed baking sheet. We prefer a small, individually packaged, dry Italian-style salami such as Genoa or soppressata, but unsliced deli salami can be used. Buy a hunk of mild provolone from the deli counter rather than presliced provolone."
