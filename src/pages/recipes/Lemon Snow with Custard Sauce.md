serves: 10
time: "50 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling"
instructions: ["FOR THE LEMON SNOW: Place cold water in medium bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over water and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Whisk boiling water into mixture until gelatin dissolves. Whisk sugar, lemon zest and juice, and salt into gelatin mixture until dissolved. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool and slightly gelatinous, about 2 hours.","Combine egg whites and gelatin mixture in stand mixer fitted with whisk. Whip on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip until soft peaks form, 11 to 14 minutes. Scrape lemon snow into bowl, or divide among dessert glasses, and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.","FOR THE CUSTARD SAUCE: Whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt in bowl until combined. Bring milk to boil in small saucepan. Slowly stir milk into yolk mixture with wooden spoon. Return milk-yolk mixture to pot, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is slightly thickened and registers 175 to 180 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour through fine-mesh strainer into 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Stir in butter and vanilla until incorporated. Refrigerate until cool and serve with Lemon Snow."]

notes: "If you’re concerned about eating raw egg whites, use pasteurized shell eggs. Plan ahead, as both the gelatin mixture and the “snow” need to chill. To reduce the chilling time, place the bowl with the gelatin mixture over a second, larger bowl of ice water and stir occasionally. To make Orange Snow, use orange juice and zest in place of the lemon.
