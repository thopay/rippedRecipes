Following photos 1 to 3 at left, cut 1/4 inch from bottom and ends of potatoes, then slice potatoes crosswise at 1/4-inch intervals, leaving 1/4 inch of potato intact.

Microwave until slightly soft to the touch, 6 to 12 minutes, flipping potatoes halfway through cooking.","Arrange potatoes, sliced-side up, on foil-lined baking sheet.
