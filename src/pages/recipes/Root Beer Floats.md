instructions: ["Soften gelatin: Place 1/2 cup root beer in small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over root beer.

notes: "Layers of bubbly root beer-flavored gelatin and soft whipped cream make up this malt-shop classic. To preserve as many bubbles as possible, use two 12-ounce bottles of root beer, opening the second bottle just before stirring it into the gelatin mixture. For a special effect, save the bubbly top of the root beer gelatin to crown the float."
