instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line standard muffin tin with cupcake liners.","Whisk butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and eggs together in large bowl. Mix in remaining ingredients until thoroughly combined.","Divide batter evenly among cupcake liners. Bake until skewer or toothpick inserted in cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes (25 minutes if using currants and walnuts). Cool cupcakes in muffin tin 5 minutes, then remove and cool completely on wire rack. Frost cupcakes with a thick and even layer of frosting. (See recipe for Fluffy Cream Cheese Frosting).","To Make Ahead Unfrosted cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. (They can also be individually wrapped in plastic and frozen in a zipper-lock bag for up to 1 month.) The frosting can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; just allow it to soften at room temperature for 30 minutes before spreading on the cupcakes. Once frosted, the cupcakes are best eaten within 1 day, but leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for several days."]

notes: "If you prefer, you can grind the carrots in a food processor rather than grate them by hand. If you add the optional currants and walnuts, the cupcakes will need to bake an additional 7 to 10 minutes. If you use walnuts, toast a few extra and use them as a garnish. This recipe is easily doubled."
