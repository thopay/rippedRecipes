serves: 6
time: "1 hour, plus 1 hour marinating"
instructions: ["FOR THE PORK CHOPS: Combine fish sauce, sugar, oil, ginger, garlic, lime zest, salt, and pepper in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Transfer pork to bag; press air from bag, seal bag closed, and then turn bag to coat pork in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.","Heat cast-iron grill pan over medium heat for 10 minutes. Using tongs, lightly moisten folded paper towel with oil and swipe towel over small area of grill pan; a sufficiently preheated pan will begin smoking within 5 seconds of oiling. Place 4 pieces pork in pan (handle will be very hot) and press gently with tongs to ensure even contact. Cook pork without moving it until well marked on first side, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, flip pork and continue to cook until well marked on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer pork to serving platter, tent with aluminum foil, and repeat with remaining 4 pieces pork; discard marinade. Let pork rest for 10 minutes.","FOR THE SALAD: Toss all ingredients together in bowl. Serve pork with salad."]

notes: "If ½-inch-thick chops are unavailable, use four 1-inch-thick chops and cut them in half horizontally. Combine the salad ingredients just before serving. A clean, well-seasoned grill pan will prevent sticking. For a spicier dish, use the full Thai chile."
