instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.","Bring water to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add dates and simmer until tender and most of water has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Using rubber spatula, press dates through fine-mesh strainer into medium bowl. Scrape dates remaining in strainer into bowl (you should have 1/4 cup puree). Cook butter in small saucepan over medium heat until nutty brown, about 4 minutes. Let cool.","Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. With electric mixer on medium speed, beat melted butter, brown sugar, and date puree in large bowl until blended. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined. Add flour mixture and mix on low until just combined. Reserve 2 tablespoons chips, and stir remaining chips into batter by hand.","Following photos, form dough into 18 cookies and space them 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Press remaining 2 tablespoons chips evenly over cookies.","Bake until edges are light golden brown and centers are soft and puffy, 15 to 18 minutes, rotating baking sheet front to back halfway through baking. Cool cookies completely on baking sheets. Serve. (Cookies will keep in airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]
