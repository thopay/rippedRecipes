Reserve 2 teaspoons bacon fat, then transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate. Blot bacon with paper towels to remove excess grease.","CRISP SKINS Quarter potatoes lengthwise, let cool 5 minutes, and then scoop out most of flesh (reserve for another use), leaving ¼-inch layer of potato flesh. Brush exterior of potatoes with reserved bacon fat and season with salt and pepper. Transfer potatoes, skin-side down, to preheated baking sheet and bake until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.","FILL SKINS Combine cheeses, cornstarch, half of bacon, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in bowl. Remove potato shells from oven and top with cheese mixture. Return to oven and bake until cheese melts, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer skins to paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with remaining bacon. Serve."]
