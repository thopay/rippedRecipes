ingredients: ["4 , medium plum tomatoes, cored, seeded, and chopped","1/2 teaspoon, salt","1 cup, shredded mozzarella cheese","1/2 cup, grated Parmesan cheese","1/2 cup, finely chopped fresh basil","1 cup, all-purpose flour","1/2 teaspoon, baking powder","1/2 teaspoon, sugar","1/2 teaspoon, salt","1/3 cup, beer (see Step by Step)","7 tablespoons, olive oil"]
serves: 2
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["For the toppings: Toss tomatoes and salt in large bowl, then transfer to paper towel-lined plate; let drain 15 minutes. Combine cheeses and basil in medium bowl; refrigerate while preparing dough.","For the dough: Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in food processor. With processor running, slowly add beer and 1 tablespoon oil and process until dough pulls away from sides and forms shaggy ball, about 1 minute. Using floured hands, form dough into tight ball and cover loosely with plastic wrap; let rest 10 minutes. (Dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and frozen for up to 1 week.)","Divide dough in half. On lightly floured surface, roll each half into very thin 9-inch round. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until just smoking. Following photos 1 to 3 (see \"Cook Thin-Crust Skillet Pizza\"), transfer one dough round to skillet and cook, poking any bubbles that form with fork, until bottom is deep golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip dough and sprinkle with half of drained tomatoes and half of cheese mixture. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until second side is crisp and cheeses have melted, about 5 minutes. Transfer pizza to cutting board. Wipe out pan and repeat with remaining oil, dough, and toppings. Slice into wedges. Serve."]

notes: "To save time, combine the cheeses and prepare the dough while the salted tomatoes are draining. When popping the bubbles in the dough in step 3, do so gently to avoid scratching the nonstick pan."
