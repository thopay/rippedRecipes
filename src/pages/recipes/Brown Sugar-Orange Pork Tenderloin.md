serves: 4
time: "55 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Combine sugar, thyme, orange zest, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and cayenne in bowl; set aside. Pat tenderloins dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add tenderloins and cook until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.","Off heat, sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over tops of tenderloins, pressing to adhere (itâ€™s OK if some falls off). Transfer skillet to oven and roast until meat registers 135 degrees, 10 to 14 minutes. Transfer tenderloins to plate, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.","Add water, vinegar, orange juice, and any accumulated pork juices to liquid left in skillet. Place skillet over medium heat (skillet handle will be hot) and cook until sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes, pressing on any solid bits of sugar with spatula to dissolve. Slice tenderloins 1/2 inch thick and serve with sauce."]

notes: "The Microplane Premium Classic Zester/Grater is our winning zesting tool. Do not use dark brown sugar here, as it is too strong-tasting for this sauce."
