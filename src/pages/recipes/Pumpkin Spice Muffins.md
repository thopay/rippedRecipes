notes: "Our favorite canned pumpkin puree is made by Libby’s. One 15-ounce can of pumpkin puree is more than enough for this recipe. You can transfer the leftover pumpkin to a zipper-lock bag and freeze it for up to a month. If youd prefer, to make your own,&nbsp;use our recipe for homemade pumpkin pie spice."
