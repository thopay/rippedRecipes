instructions: ["FOR THE SHORT RIBS: Combine salt, pepper, sugar, smoked paprika, coriander, and allspice in small bowl. Pat short ribs dry and sprinkle all over with salt mixture. Transfer to large plate, cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Evenly space short ribs on prepared rack. Roast until meat registers between 135 and 140 degrees, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.","FOR THE BROWNED BUTTER STEAK SAUCE: Meanwhile, melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until milk solids in butter are color of milk chocolate and have nutty aroma, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shallot and garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and immediately whisk in Worcestershire, vinegar, Dijon, sugar, soy sauce, and pepper; set aside.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sear short ribs until well browned on top and bottom, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.","Reheat sauce over medium heat, whisking frequently, until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Slice short ribs against grain as thin as possible. Serve, passing sauce separately."]
