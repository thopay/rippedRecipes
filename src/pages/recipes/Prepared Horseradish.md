notes: "We call for canning and pickling salt here, which is often called preserving salt. Noniodized table salt can be used in an equal amount. To substitute Morton Kosher Salt for the canning and pickling salt, increase the amount to 1½ teaspoons; to use Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt, increase the amount to 2 teaspoons."
