Add 2 tablespoons milk to flour mixture; using your fingers, rub flour and milk until milk is fully incorporated and shaggy pieces of dough form. Whisk eggs together in second shallow dish.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Pat chops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with 1 chop at a time, dredge chops in flour mixture, shaking off any excess; dip into eggs to thoroughly coat, letting excess drip back into dish; and dredge again in flour mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer to prepared wire rack. Refrigerate coated chops for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours.","Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Add 2 chops and cook until golden brown and meat registers 140 degrees, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chops.","Carefully pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet and place skillet over medium heat. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons flour, 1 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until bubbly and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining 1 1/2 cups milk, bring to boil, and cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve gravy with chops."]

notes: "Use pork chops no more than 1/2 inch thick to ensure that the meat cooks through before the breading begins to burn. If you can find only chops that are slightly thicker than 1/2 inch, thin them with a meat pounder."
