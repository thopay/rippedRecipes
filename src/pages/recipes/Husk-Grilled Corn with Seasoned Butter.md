ingredients: ["6 ears, corn, unshucked","6 tablespoons, unsalted butter, softened","1/2 teaspoon, table salt","1/2 teaspoon, pepper"]
serves: 6
time: "1½ hours"
instructions: ["Cut and remove silk protruding from top of each ear of corn. Combine butter, salt, and pepper in bowl. Transfer 3 tablespoons butter mixture to large plate. Set aside remaining butter mixture.","For a charcoal grill: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter mounded with charcoal briquettes (7 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","For a gas grill: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.","Place corn on grill (on hotter side if using charcoal, with stem ends facing cooler side). Cover and cook, turning corn every 3 minutes, until husks are blackened all over, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer corn to cutting board. Using chef's knife, cut stem end off each ear of corn. Holding 1 ear at a time with dish towel, use tongs to peel away and discard husks and silk.","Roll each ear in butter mixture on plate to coat lightly, letting excess butter mixture drip back onto plate. Return corn to grill (on hotter side if using charcoal). Cook, uncovered, turning corn as needed to char lightly on each side, about 5 minutes. Remove corn from grill and roll each ear in remaining butter mixture on plate. Transfer corn to platter. Serve, passing reserved butter mixture separately."]

notes: "Look for ears of corn with green husks and golden-brown (not dark-brown) silk protruding from the tops. Also look for ears of similar size so they cook at the same rate. The seasoned butter can be made ahead and refrigerated, but let it come to room temperature before using. Set up a cutting board and knife next to your grill to avoid traveling back and forth between the kitchen and grill."
