notes: "Buy asparagus spears that are between ¼ inch and ½ inch in diameter. To trim the asparagus, hold a spear with one hand about halfway down the stalk; with the thumb and index finger of your other hand, grasp the spear about 1 inch from the bottom. Bend the stalk until it snaps, discard the bottom portion, and use the stalk as a guide for cutting the rest of the asparagus with your knife. Buy a hunk of pancetta from the deli counter rather than presliced pancetta."
