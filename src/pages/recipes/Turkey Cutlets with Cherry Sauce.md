time: ""
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position, set large heatproof plate on rack, and heat oven to 200 degrees. Sprinkle both sides of cutlets with salt and pepper.","Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place 3 cutlets in pan and cook without moving, until golden, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until meat feels firm when pressed, about 1 minute. Transfer cutlets to warm plate in oven. Cook remaining cutlets and place them on plate in oven.","Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to empty skillet and return to medium heat. Add shallots, cherries, and rosemary and cook until shallots become softened, about 1 minute. Add port and orange juice, and, using wooden spoon, scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan. Increase heat to high and simmer until liquid becomes thickened and syrupy, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, along with any accumulated juices from cutlets. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange cutlets on platter or individual plates and spoon sauce over them. Serve."]
nutrition: undefined
notes: "One cutlet per person makes a skimpy serving, so we call for a total of six to serve four people. Add rice pilaf or mashed potatoes and a green vegetable, such as our Nutty Green Beans."
