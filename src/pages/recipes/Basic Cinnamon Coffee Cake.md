Dollop remaining batter evenly over filling and spread to edges of pan with offset spatula. Crumble streusel into pea-size crumbs evenly over top layer of batter.","Bake until center of cake is set and toothpick inserted in center comes out with few moist crumbs attached, 45 to 50 minutes.

notes: "We developed this recipe using a metal baking pan. If using a glass or ceramic baking dish, increase the baking time to 55 minutes and let the cake cool for 45 minutes before cutting it. We prefer dark brown sugar in this recipe, but you can use light brown sugar instead."
