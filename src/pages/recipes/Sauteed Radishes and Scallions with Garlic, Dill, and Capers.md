notes: "If you buy radishes without the greens attached, you’ll need only about 1 pound. Radishes with greens will be fresher. If the diameters of your radishes are less than 1 inch, cut them in half. If your scallions are thicker than a pencil, halve them lengthwise. We like to serve this dish as an accompaniment to seared or grilled chicken or fish."
