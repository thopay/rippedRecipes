ingredients: ["1 , boneless, skinless turkey breast (3 to 4 pounds)","2 cups, recipe stuffing","2 tablespoons, vegetable oil","1 tablespoon, sugar","2 teaspoons, ground black pepper","1 teaspoon, table salt"]
serves: 8
time: ""
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Following the photos, butterfly turkey, cover with plastic wrap, and pound lightly with meat mallet until about 1/2 inch thick. Spread stuffing in even layer over turkey. Starting with short side nearest you, roll up turkey and tie at 1-inch intervals.","Rub turkey with oil and sprinkle evenly with sugar, pepper, and salt. Place on wire rack set over rimmed baking sheet and roast, turning every 30 minutes, until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours. Transfer turkey to cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Remove twine and slice crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve.","MAKE AHEAD: Once stuffed and tied, the turkey breast can be held in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before roasting. Or just make either stuffing (see related recipes) in advance. Both will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."]

notes: "Before stuffing the turkey, make sure the stuffing is completely chilled. Some stores only sell boneless turkey breasts with the skin still attached; the skin can be removed easily with a paring knife. This recipe calls for one turkey breast half. Dont buy an entire breast with two lobes of meat; its too large for this recipe."
