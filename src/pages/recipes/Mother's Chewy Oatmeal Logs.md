instructions: ["FOR THE COOKIES: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and ginger in bowl; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat shortening and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined. Add molasses and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture in 3 additions, and mix until just combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Add oats, raisins, and walnuts, and oats and mix until incorporated.","Form dough into four 9 by 2-inch logs and place 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned and just set, 16 to 19 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool on sheets for 5 minutes. Slide parchment onto cutting board and, using sharp knife, cut logs crosswise into 1½-inch-thick bars. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.","FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk sugar, milk, and vanilla all ingredients together in bowl until smooth. Drizzle glaze over cookies and let sit for 15 minutes to firm. Serve. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)"]
