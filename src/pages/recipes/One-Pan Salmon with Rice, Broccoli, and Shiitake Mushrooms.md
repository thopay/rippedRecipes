instructions: ["For the rice, vegetables, and salmon: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine broth, rice, and ½ teaspoon salt in broiler-safe 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Jiggle dish on counter to even out layer of rice. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake until rice is tender, about 30 minutes.","For the sauce: Meanwhile, stir all ingredients together in bowl. Transfer ¼ cup sauce to second bowl; set aside both bowls.","Remove dish from oven and heat broiler. Carefully remove foil, allowing steam to escape away from you; discard foil. Toss broccoli, mushrooms, oil, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt together in third bowl. Place 1 salmon fillet, skinned side down, along each side of dish. Brush tops and sides of fillets with reserved ¼ cup sauce. Place vegetables in center and corners of dish so no rice is exposed (do not cover fillets).","Return dish to oven and broil until vegetables are very dark around edges and centers of fillets are still translucent when checked with tip of paring knife and register 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 9 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with scallions and serve, passing remaining sauce separately."]

notes: "You will need a broiler-safe 13 by 9-inch baking dish for this recipe. Do not use a Pyrex dish; it is not broiler-safe. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs almost clear, about 1½ minutes, stirring the rice with your hand every so often."
