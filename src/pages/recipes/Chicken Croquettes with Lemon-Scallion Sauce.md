time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["FOR THE LEMON-SCALLION SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.","FOR THE CROQUETTES: Process bread and flour in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds; transfer to shallow dish. Beat eggs together in second shallow dish. Set aside bread-crumb mixture and eggs.","Combine chicken, potato flakes, scallions, garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne in large bowl. Combine half-and-half and butter in 2-cup liquid measuring cup and microwave, covered, until butter is melted and mixture is hot, about 3 minutes. Add to chicken mixture and stir to combine (mixture will thicken as it sits).","Divide chicken mixture into 20 equal portions (about 2 tablespoons each). Using your moistened hands, shape each portion into 3-inch log with pointed ends. Working with 3 to 4 croquettes at a time, dip in eggs, turning to coat and allowing excess to drip off; then coat with bread-crumb mixture. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. (Breaded croquettes can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Line second rimmed baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees. Add 10 croquettes and cook until deep golden brown on first side, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, carefully flip croquettes and continue to cook until deep golden brown on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 300 and 350 degrees.","Transfer croquettes to paper towel–lined sheet. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining croquettes. Serve with lemon-scallion sauce."]

notes: "An average-size rotisserie chicken should yield between 3 and 4 cups of shredded meat, which is more than enough for this recipe."
