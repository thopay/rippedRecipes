notes: "Even though we used 2/3 cup, we found that the type of honey didn’t affect the flavor of the cornbread much—except with very strong honey, such as buckwheat. That lent a distinctive deep, molasses-y flavor that some of our tasters didn’t like. The test kitchen’s favorite cornmeal is Anson Mills Fine Yellow Cornmeal."
