notes: "Vegetable oil can be substituted for the coconut oil, if desired. If you cannot find a serrano chile, you can substitute one jalapeno. If youre spice averse, consider halving the chile and removing the seeds. We recommend wearing rubber gloves when handling the chile. The skillet will be very full when you add the cabbage to it in step 1, but the pieces will shrink as they cook."
