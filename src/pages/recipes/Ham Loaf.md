notes: "“Ham loaf is a favorite at our family dinners and church socials. I love the saltiness of the ham with the sweet glaze. Because the loaf is rich, I usually serve it with simple baked or boiled potatoes.” The test kitchen recommends that you line the rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup."
