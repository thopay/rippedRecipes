notes: "When purchasing lemons, choose large ones that give to gentle pressure; hard lemons have thicker skin and yield less juice. Lemons are commonly waxed to prevent moisture loss, increase shelf life, and protect from bruising during shipping. Scrub them with a vegetable brush under running water to remove wax, or buy organic lemons. Don’t worry about the seeds in the extracted juice; the entire mixture is strained at the end of the recipe. Serve poured over ice, if desired. Note that we recommend chilling the lemonade for 1 hour prior to serving."
