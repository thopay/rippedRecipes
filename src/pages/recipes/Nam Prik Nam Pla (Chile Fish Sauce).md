notes: "The range for Thai chiles given here is an attempt to tailor this recipe to American tastes. Use one chile for an extra-mild version of this sauce; two chiles for medium-mild; three for medium; and four for medium‑spicy. It’s typical for recipes to call for more chiles for this amount of sauce, so if you know you like heat, add more to suit your taste. If you can’t find Thai chiles, you can substitute serrano chiles. Use one serrano for every two Thai chiles."
