notes: "If you know that you’re going to make this chicken salad with leftover Alabama BBQ Chicken (see related recipe), prepare a double batch of the White BBQ Sauce before grilling the chicken and save half for this dish. You’ll also need 2 cups of leftover shredded chicken. To make the dish spicier, leave the seeds in the jalapeno."
