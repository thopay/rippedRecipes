(Beans can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 3 days. Alternatively, beans can be cooled, transferred to zipper-lock bags, and frozen for up to 1 month.)","Combine ¼ cup oil and garlic in 12-inch nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat until garlic begins to brown lightly at edges, about 3 minutes.","Add sage and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
