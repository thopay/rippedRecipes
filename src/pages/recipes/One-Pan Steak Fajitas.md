notes: "Serve the fajitas with pico de gallo, avocado or guacamole, sour cream, your favorite hot sauce, and lime wedges. We cook the flank steak to medium so that it is less chewy and therefore easier to eat. We call for red bell peppers in this recipe, but for a more colorful presentation, use a mix of red, yellow, orange, and/or green."
