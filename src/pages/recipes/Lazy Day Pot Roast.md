instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add beef and cook until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to plate.","Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot. Add onions and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in vinegar, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in broth, sugar, marjoram, bay leaves, and caraway seeds. Add beef, along with any accumulated juices, and bring to simmer. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook until fork slips easily in and out of beef, about 3 hours, flipping beef once halfway through cooking.","Transfer beef to carving board and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Let braising liquid settle for 5 minutes, then, using shallow spoon, skim any fat from surface.","Bring braising liquid to boil over medium-high heat. Add apples and cook until very tender, about 20 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer apples to serving platter. Continue to boil sauce until reduced to about 2 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Discard twine, slice beef against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices, and transfer to platter with apples. Using slotted spoon, remove onions from braising liquid and spoon over beef. Pour 1 1/2 cups sauce over beef. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately."]

notes: "It is in fact simple, but the unusual flavors of marjoram and caraway seeds—not to mention apples—in a pot roast take it out of the ordinary."
