notes: "Red potatoes are best here because their sturdy nature means they won’t break apart in the hash. Look for small Brussels sprouts, no bigger than a golf ball, as they’re likely to be sweeter and more tender than large sprouts. If you can find only large sprouts, halve them and cut each half into thirds."
