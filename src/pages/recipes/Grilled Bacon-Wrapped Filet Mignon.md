(For charcoal grill, light 100 coals until covered with fine gray ash, then spread two-thirds of coals over half of grill and remaining coals in single layer over other half. Set cooking grate in place and heat covered, with vent lid opened completely, for 5 minutes). Scrape and oil cooking grate. Grill steaks, covered, over cooler side of grill until internal temperatures of meat registers 100 degrees, 7 to 14 minutes. Remove bacon from top of steaks and cook on cooler side until crisp. Flip steaks and grill, covered, over hotter side of grill until steaks register 125 to 130 degrees (for medium-rare), 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to plate, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes.
