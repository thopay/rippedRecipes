notes: "We prefer untreated shrimp—those not treated with salt or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate. Most frozen E-Z peel shrimp have been treated (the ingredient list should tell you). If youre using treated shrimp, do not season the shrimp with salt in step 1. If the fennel doesnt have fronds, increase the parsley amount to ¼ cup chopped. Serve with crusty bread."
