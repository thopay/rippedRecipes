notes: "To save time, we shred the cabbage in a food processor fitted with a slicing disk. If you don’t have a food processor, slice the cabbage wedges crosswise 1/8 inch thick. Shred the carrots on the large holes of a box grater. For an extra spicy kick, up the horseradish to 2 tablespoons. The flavors will intensify as the coleslaw chills."
