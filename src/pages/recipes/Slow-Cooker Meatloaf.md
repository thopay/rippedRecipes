Whisk shallot mixture and eggs into saltine mixture.","Add pork to saltine mixture and mix until thoroughly combined. Add ground beef and knead until well combined. Fold 18-inch square of heavy-duty aluminum foil in half to make 18 by 9-inch strip. Form meat mixture into 9 by 4-inch loaf and place crosswise over center of strip. Using foil as sling, transfer meatloaf to slow cooker. Cover and cook until meatloaf registers 160 degrees, about 4 hours on low.","Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Whisk ketchup and sugar together in bowl. Using sling, transfer meatloaf to rimmed baking sheet and brush with glaze. Broil until glaze is bubbly and spotty brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to serving dish (discard sling), tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Slice and serve."]
