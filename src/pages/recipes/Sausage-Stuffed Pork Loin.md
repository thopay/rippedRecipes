Transfer to large zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 4 hours.","MAKE FILLING Cook sausage in large skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to food processor and pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan. Add bread, cheese, and egg to processor and pulse until coarsely ground; set aside.","ROLL AND BROWN Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Remove pork from bag and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange pork, fat cap down, on work surface. Cover surface of meat with processed sausage mixture, leaving ½-inch border on all sides. Roll tightly, then tie roast at 1-inch intervals with kitchen twine. Season with pepper. Heat reserved fat in skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown roast on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork, fat side up, to wire rack set inside prepared baking sheet.","ROAST PORK Roast until thickest part of meat registers 140 degrees, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer pork to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest 20 minutes. Remove twine. Cut into ½-inch slices and serve."]

notes: "Cook the pork on a wire or V-rack; placed right on the baking sheet, the meat may seize, forcing the stuffing out of the roll."
