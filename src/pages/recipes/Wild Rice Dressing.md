instructions: ["COOK RICE Bring broth, water, and bay leaf to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Strain contents of pan through fine-mesh strainer into large liquid measuring cup. Transfer rice to medium bowl; discard bay leaf. Reserve 1½ cups cooking liquid.","TOAST BREAD Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Pulse half of bread in food processor until pea-size pieces remain and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bread and another rimmed baking sheet. Bake bread crumbs until golden, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and switching and rotating baking sheets halfway through baking. Cool completely, about 10 minutes.","SAUTE AROMATICS Melt 4 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat. Cook onions and celery until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, sage, and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved cooking liquid, remove from heat, and cool 5 minutes.","ASSEMBLE AND BAKE Whisk cream, eggs, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Slowly whisk in warm broth mixture. Stir in rice and toasted bread crumbs and transfer to 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Melt remaining butter in now-empty skillet and drizzle evenly over dressing. Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake on lower-middle rack until set, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove foil and let cool 15 minutes. Serve.","MAKE AHEAD: Assembled dressing can be refrigerated in baking dish, covered, for 1 day. To finish, melt remaining butter, drizzle over dressing, and proceed with recipe, adding 20 minutes to baking time."]

notes: "Depending on the brand, wild rice absorbs varying quantities of liquid. If you have less than 1½ cups of leftover cooking liquid, make up the difference with additional low-sodium chicken broth."
