ingredients: ["2 cups, long-grain white rice","3 cups, water","1/2 teaspoon, salt (optional)"]
serves: 6
time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under running water until water running through rice is almost clear, about 1½ minutes, agitating rice with your hand every so often.","Combine rice, water, and salt, if using, in large saucepan and bring to simmer over high heat. Stir rice with rubber spatula, dislodging any rice that sticks to bottom of saucepan.","Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook for 20 minutes. (Steam should steadily emit from sides of saucepan. If water bubbles out from under lid, reduce heat slightly.)","Remove from heat; do not uncover. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Gently fluff rice with fork. Serve.","TO DOUBLE THIS RECIPE: Increase rice to 4 cups and water to 6 cups. In step 2, use Dutch oven instead of large saucepan. After rice comes to simmer, cover pot, transfer to middle rack of 350-degree oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and continue with step 4."]

notes: "Its important to rinse the rice before cooking it to remove excess starch from the grains. Omit the salt if youre serving this rice with a salty dish such as a stir-fry."
