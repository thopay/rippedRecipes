instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 475 degrees. Brush two baking sheets with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil each. Combine cheeses in small bowl.","Bring 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to boil in large skillet over high heat. Add broccoli, cover, and simmer until broccoli is just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly and roughly chop. Wipe skillet dry, add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and garlic, and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss in broccoli and season with salt and pepper to taste.","On lightly floured counter, roll out one ball of dough to 12-inch round. Transfer to one baking sheet. Roll out second dough ball and place on second baking sheet. Mound half of cheese on one side of each dough round, leaving 1-inch border around edges. Top each with half of broccoli. Brush dough edges with water, fold over filling, press edges to seal, and cut 5 slits in top of dough. Bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "We had good results with Pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough, but ready-made dough from your local pizzeria is an even better choice. If you use the Pillsbury dough, simply unroll it and use the rectangular shape. If you like, serve the calzones with your favorite basic tomato sauce."
