description: "With the average slice weighing in at over 700 calories, meatloaf is a prime candidate for a recipe makeover. The challenge arises if you want to keep the meat 100 percent beef-and keep the meatloaf 100 percent edible."

Add mushrooms and cook until they release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato juice and cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Let mixture cool 5 minutes, then transfer mixture to food processor, add bread, and process until smooth. Add beef to food processor and pulse to combine.","Whisk egg, soy sauce, mustard, parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in large bowl. Add beef mixture and mix with hands until evenly combined. Using hands, shape mixture into loaf covering entirety of prepared foil. Bake until meatloaf registers 160 degrees, about 1 hour. Remove meatloaf from oven and heat broiler.","For the glaze: Combine ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, and sugar in small saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Spread glaze over meatloaf and broil until glaze begins to bubble, about 3 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes. Serve."]
