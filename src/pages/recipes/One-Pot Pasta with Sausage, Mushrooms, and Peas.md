notes: "You can substitute white mushrooms for the cremini and 12 ounces (3⅓ cups) of orecchiette for the medium pasta shells. if desired. The pasta will not absorb all the cooking liquid in step 2; stirring vigorously in step 3 helps thicken the sauce so it will coat the pasta. For a nonalcoholic version, substitute ½ cup of water for the wine in step 2 and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice with the lemon zest in step 3. There is no need to thaw the peas."
