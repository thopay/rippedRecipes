Grease one 15 by 11-inch sheet of aluminum foil with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Combine raisins and water in bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Set aside and let raisins soften for at least 15 minutes; drain.","Meanwhile, toss bread, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in large bowl; spread evenly on rimmed baking sheet. Combine mushrooms, kale, onion, garlic, sage, remaining 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in now-empty bowl; spread on second rimmed baking sheet. Break sausage into 1/2-inch pieces and distribute evenly over vegetables.","Bake bread mixture on upper rack and vegetable mixture on lower rack until bread is golden brown but still tender inside and vegetables and sausage are golden, about 30 minutes, stirring halfway through baking. Transfer sheets to wire racks and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Combine toasted bread and vegetable mixture in large bowl.","Stir broth, eggs, and drained raisins into bread-vegetable mixture until liquid is absorbed. Transfer dressing to prepared dish. Cut remaining 2 tablespoons butter into 1/4-inch pieces and sprinkle evenly over dressing. Cover tightly with prepared foil.","Bake dressing on lower rack for 15 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until top is golden and crisp, about 15 minutes longer. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. TO MAKE AHEAD: Dressing can be made through step 4 and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Increase covered baking time by 5 minutes."]
