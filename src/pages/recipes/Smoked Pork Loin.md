ingredients: ["1/4 cup, Dijon mustard","1/4 cup, whiskey, preferably bourbon (see note)","1/4 cup, soy sauce","1/4 cup, packed brown sugar","2 tablespoons, Worcestershire sauce","4 , garlic cloves, minced","2 1/2 pound, boneless pork loin roast, fat on top scored lightly and tied (see tip)","1 tablespoon, brown sugar","1 tablespoon, paprika","2 teaspoons, chili powder","2 teaspoons, ground cumin","1 teaspoon, dried oregano","1 teaspoon, salt","1 teaspoon, pepper","1/4 teaspoon, cayenne pepper","2 cups, wood chips, soaked for 15 minutes"]
serves: 8
time: "2Â¼ hours, plus 2 hours marinating"
instructions: ["For the marinade: Whisk mustard, whiskey, soy sauce, sugar, Worcestershire, and garlic in bowl. Place marinade and pork in gallon-size zipper-lock bag. Press air out of bag, seal, and refrigerate for 2 hours, flipping bag after 1 hour to ensure that pork marinates evenly. (Pork can marinate for up to 8 hours.)","For the spice rub: Combine all ingredients except wood chips in small bowl. Remove pork from marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and rub spice mixture all over roast.","Seal wood chips in foil packet and cut vent holes in top. Open bottom vent on grill. Light 100 coals; when covered with fine gray ash, spread over half of grill. Arrange foil packet directly on coals. Set cooking grate in place and heat, covered, with lid vent open completely, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 5 minutes. (For gas grill, place foil packet directly on primary burner. Heat all burners on high, covered, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn other burner[s] off.) Scrape and oil cooking grate.","Arrange roast fat-side up on cooler side of grill. Cook, covered, until meat registers 130 to 135 degrees, about 1 hour, flipping and rotating roast once halfway through cooking. Move roast to hot side of grill and cook, covered, until pork is well browned on all sides and meat registers 140 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 15 minutes (temperature will rise to 150 degrees). Remove twine. Slice and serve."]

notes: "Look for a pork roast with about 1/4 inch of fat on top. This pork is juicy and flavorful enough to stand alone, but it also goes well with any of our quick No-Cook Barbecue Sauces (see related content.) While we prefer bourbon for its smoky sweetness, feel free to substitute whatever American whiskey you have on hand."
