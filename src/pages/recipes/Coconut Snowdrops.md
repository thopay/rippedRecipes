description: "These cookies contain snowy mounds of coconut with an almond accent. They will spread and fall during baking if the dough gets too warm. For the best texture, chill the dough well before forming the cookies and roll only half the dough at a time, keeping the other half in the refrigerator."

instructions: ["For the cookies: With electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and sugars until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg, yolk, and extracts until incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low; add flour, coconut, and almonds; mix until dough forms, about 1 minute. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into 3/4-inch balls and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake until edges are just golden, 12 to 14 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cool 10 minutes on sheets, then transfer to wire rack and cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.","For the chocolate filling: Melt chocolate and butter in saucepan over low heat until smooth, about 5 minutes. Spread chocolate mixture on bottom of 1 cookie, then press bottom of second cookie onto chocolate to form sandwich. Repeat with remaining cookies and chocolate mixture. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.)"]
