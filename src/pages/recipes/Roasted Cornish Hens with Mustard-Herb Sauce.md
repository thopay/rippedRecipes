instructions: ["FOR THE HENS: Pat hens dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Tie legs together with twine and tuck wingtips behind backs. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Place hens on wire rack and refrigerate, uncovered, for 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Brush hens evenly with oil and roast until breasts register between 155 and 160 degrees and legs register at least 175 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating halfway through roasting.","FOR THE MUSTARD-HERB SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in small bowl.","Remove sheet from oven and let hens rest for 20 minutes; remove twine.

notes: "The 24-hour salting and resting period is key to seasoning the meat and drying out the skin so that it becomes crispy when roasted. We developed this recipe using Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt; if using Morton Kosher Salt, reduce the amounts of salt to 3 tablespoons for the hens and ½ teaspoon for the sauce. We prefer Bell &amp; Evans Cornish Game Hens."
