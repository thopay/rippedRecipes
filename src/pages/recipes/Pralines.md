ingredients: ["1 cup (7 ounces), granulated sugar","1 cup packed (7 ounces), light brown sugar","3/4 cup, evaporated milk","6 tablespoons, unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces","1/2 teaspoon, table salt","1 1/2 cups, pecans, chopped"]
serves: 16
time: "45 minutes, plus 1 hour cooling"
instructions: ["Using pencil, draw 8 evenly spaced 3-inch circles, in 2 rows of 4, on each of two 16 by 12-inch sheets of parchment paper. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with marked parchment, marked side down.","Combine granulated sugar, brown sugar, evaporated milk, butter, and salt in large saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently with long-handled metal spoon. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and continue to boil, stirring frequently and making sure to scrape corners of saucepan, until mixture registers 236 to 238 degrees, 9 to 13 minutes longer. (To take temperature, tilt saucepan so sugar mixture pools to 1 side.)","Reduce heat to low and stir in pecans. Stir constantly over low heat for 3 minutes (mixture will thicken slightly and lighten in color).","Keep saucepan over low heat. Working quickly, spoon approximate 2-tablespoon portions of praline mixture onto each parchment circle and immediately spread with spoon so mixture fills out circle (use dinner spoon to help scrape mixture from long-handled spoon if necessary).","Let sit until firm, at least 1 hour. (Be careful when moving sheets; underside will be hot after portioning pralines.) Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Pralines can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month."]

notes: "You will need a digital instant-read thermometer for this recipe. It is important to use a long-handled metal spoon to stir and portion these candies so that your hands remain a safe distance from the hot sugar. In step 4, you may end up with fewer than 16 pralines. The 3-inch circles on the underside of the parchment paper will help with portioning. A standard 12-ounce can of evaporated milk is about 3 inches in diameter."
