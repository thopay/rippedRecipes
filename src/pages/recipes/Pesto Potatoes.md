time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Combine 2 quarts water, potatoes, and 1 tablespoon salt in Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are easily pierced with tip of paring knife but do not break apart, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain potatoes thoroughly and transfer to large bowl. Let potatoes cool slightly, about 20 minutes.","Meanwhile, toast garlic in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until skins are just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add pine nuts and continue to toast until garlic is spotty brown and pine nuts are golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to plate and let cool slightly.","When cool enough to handle, peel garlic. Process garlic, basil, ¼ cup Parmesan, lemon zest and juice, and 1 teaspoon salt in food processor until coarsely ground, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. With processor running, slowly add oil and process until smooth, about 1 minute.","Add pesto, capers, shallot, pine nuts, and remaining ¼ cup Parmesan to potatoes and stir gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature."]
