notes: "Salsa verde is a green salsa made from tomatillos and green chiles. We developed this recipe using Frontera Tomatillo Salsa. When buying the dried chiles, 1½ ounces of ancho chiles will be two to three chiles, and 1 ounce of pasilla chiles will be about four chiles. Both light and dark brown sugars work for this recipe. We like flour tortillas here, but corn tortillas work well, too. If queso fresco is unavailable, you can substitute farmers cheese or a mild feta. This dish is also great served over rice."
