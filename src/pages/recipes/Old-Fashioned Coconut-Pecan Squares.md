instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and ½ cup brown sugar on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add flour and ½ teaspoon salt and continue to beat until dough begins to form, about 2 minutes longer. Press dough evenly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes.","Using clean, dry mixer bowl fitted with whisk, whip 3 egg whites on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer whites to separate bowl; set aside.","Return now-empty bowl to mixer still fitted with whisk and whip vanilla, remaining 2 cups brown sugar, 2 whole eggs, remaining 3 egg yolks, and ½ teaspoon salt on medium-high speed until thick, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Fold in pecans, coconut, and reserved whipped egg whites by hand until fully incorporated.","Spread mixture evenly over cooled crust. Bake until top is deep golden brown, 24 to 26 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool completely. Run paring knife around edges of pan to release bars. Cut into 2-inch squares and dust with confectioners’ sugar. Serve."]
