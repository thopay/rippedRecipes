notes: "If you cannot find Vidalia or other sweet onions, you can substitute a regular white or yellow onion. If substituting, place the sliced onion in a colander and rinse under cold running water for about 20 seconds before patting the slices dry with paper towels and combining them with the tomatoes. For the best results, we recommend using seasonal heirloom tomatoes here."
