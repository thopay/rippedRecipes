serves: 6
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["COOK POTATOES Bring potatoes and enough water to cover by 1 inch to boil in large pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are tender but not falling apart, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and return to pot; let stand 5 minutes.","MASH POTATOES Transfer 1 cup potatoes to bowl and toss with butter. Mash buttered potatoes until smooth, then gently combine with remaining potatoes. Mix in salt and pepper.","BROWN POTATOES Adjust oven rack to upper position (about 4 inches below broiler element) and heat broiler. Invert rimmed baking sheet and coat lightly with cooking spray. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add potatoes and lightly pat into a circle. Cook until bottom is crusty and golden brown, 7 to 9 minutes.","BROIL POTATOES Slide hash browns out of skillet onto prepared baking sheet with browned side facing down. Brush top with remaining oil and broil until deep golden brown, 10 to 14 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes, then carefully slide onto platter. Cut into wedges and serve."]

notes: "Dont let the boiled potatoes sit in water or they will become mushy. Drying them in step 1 makes for a deeply golden crust. Start checking the potatoes early in step 4. You can use a rimless cookie sheet in place of the inverted baking sheet."
