Divide mixture into 20 portions, about 2 tablespoons each. Roll portions between your wet hands to form meatballs. Transfer meatballs to plate and refrigerate for 15 minutes.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add meatballs and cook until well browned all over, 5 to 7 minutes. Return meatballs to plate, leaving fat in skillet.","Add bell peppers to now-empty skillet; cook until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until edges of grains begin to turn translucent, about 1 minute. Stir in water, coconut milk, remaining 1 tablespoon fish sauce, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt and bring to boil.","Return meatballs to skillet. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook for 20 minutes.","Without removing lid, remove skillet from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Gently stir peas into rice.

notes: "Do not use 99 percent lean ground turkey; it will make dry meatballs. We like the flavor of jasmine rice here, though any long-grain white rice will work. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under running water until the water runs almost clear, about 1½ minutes, agitating the rice a few times with your hand. We developed this recipe with Aroy-D Coconut Milk. A 12-inch nonstick skillet with a tight-fitting lid is essential. Turn the meatballs gently in step 2 so that they wont break."
