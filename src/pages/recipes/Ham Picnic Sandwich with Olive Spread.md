instructions: ["For the sandwich: Line the rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and grease parchment. Place dough on prepared sheet. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.","Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Keeping dough on sheet, use your hands to shape dough into rough 7-inch square (edges may be rounded; this is OK). Brush top of dough with oil. Bake until light golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely on sheet, about 1 hour.","For the spread: Meanwhile, process olives, parsley, capers, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes in food processor until finely chopped, about 20 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer to bowl and stir in oil.","Slice bread in half horizontally. Spread olive mixture on cut sides of bread, about ½ cup per piece (use all of it). Layer mozzarella, ham, parsley, and carrots on bread bottom. Cap with bread top and wrap sandwich tightly in double layer of plastic.","Place Dutch oven on top of sandwich and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. (Pressed sandwich can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let come to room temperature before serving.) Unwrap sandwich, cut into quarters, and serve."]

notes: "Letting the pizza dough sit at room temperature for 1 hour makes it easier to shape. If you dont have a Dutch oven, you can use a baking sheet or skillet loaded with canned goods to press the sandwich."
