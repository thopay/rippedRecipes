notes: "We do not recommend making this recipe with steaks thinner than 1 inch, but thicker steaks can be used. If using thicker steaks, just continue to cook them, flipping every 2 minutes, until they register 125 degrees (for medium-rare). Top sirloin steaks are commonly sold as larger steaks (about 1 pound each) that serve two people. If you can find only larger steaks, buy two steaks and cut them in half crosswise to make four steaks that are about 8 ounces each. You can substitute fresh thyme for the tarragon, if desired."
