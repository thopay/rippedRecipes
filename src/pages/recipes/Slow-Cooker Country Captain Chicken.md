description: "This Georgia chicken stew is traditionally garnished with toasted nuts, shredded coconut, and diced fresh fruit-and always served with rice. It should be tender and spicy, but a slow cooker can make the meat stringy and the sauce bland."

notes: "Basic curry powder turns bitter after six hours in a slow cooker, so stick with Madras curry powder. By tradition, this dish can be garnished with any or all of the following: sliced toasted almonds, shredded coconut, diced Granny Smith apples, and diced banana. Steamed long-grain rice is a must. Unlike beef, which can be browned and chilled the night before it goes into the slow cooker, once the chicken is browned it should be cooked right away."
