description: "On paper, honey-glazed baby back ribs make perfect sense. But somewhere between paper and plate, the pork turns bland and the glaze saccharine. We knew we could do better."

ingredients: ["5 - 6 pounds, baby back ribs (2 racks, 2 1/2- to 3-pounds each), trimmed, membranes removed, each rack cut into 3 equal pieces","1 cup, honey","5 tablespoons, soy sauce","1/4 cup, cider vinegar","1/4 cup, Dijon mustard","4 , scallions, white parts minced, green parts sliced thin","4 , garlic cloves, crushed","1.5 teaspoons, Kosher salt","1 teaspoon, black pepper","1/4 teaspoon, cayenne pepper"]
serves: 4
time: "3½ hours, plus 1 hour marinating"
instructions: ["Divide ribs between two 1-gallon zipper-lock bags. Whisk honey, soy sauce, vinegar, mustard, scallion whites, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne together in bowl. Divide marinade between bags, seal, and turn to coat ribs evenly with marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours, turning bags ­occasionally.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Add enough warm tap water to cover entire bottom of sheet (about 2 cups). Transfer ribs, meaty side up, to prepared wire rack; reserve marinade in refrigerator. Tent ribs loosely with foil and bake for 1¼ hours. Uncover ribs and continue cooking until just tender, about 1 hour longer.","Bring reserved marinade to boil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat and cook until thickened to glaze consistency, about 5 minutes. Brush ribs with 1/3 cup glaze, return to oven, and continue to cook until glaze begins to bubble and ribs are brown, 15 to 30 minutes. Transfer ribs to cutting board (leave hot water and sheet in oven to cool), tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.","Cut ribs between bones, add to Dutch oven, and toss to coat with remaining glaze. Transfer to platter and sprinkle with scallion greens and ½ teaspoon salt. Serve."]

notes: "Cutting the racks into thirds allows them to fit into the plastic bags to marinate. The used marinade is boiled and transformed into a glaze for the ribs."
