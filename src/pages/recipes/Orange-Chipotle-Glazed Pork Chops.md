Pat chops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Combine orange juice, lime juice, chiles, and sugar in bowl.","COOK CHOPS Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add pork to skillet and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes. Turn chops and add glaze mixture. Turn heat down to medium-low and cook until internal temperature registers 140 degrees, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove chops to plate and tent with foil.","REDUCE GLAZE Return any accumulated juices to skillet and simmer glaze over medium heat until thick and syrupy, then add lime zest. Pour reduced glaze over chops. Serve."]

notes: "Be careful not to overreduce the glaze in step 3. If the glaze thickens to the correct consistency before the chops reach 140 degrees, add a few tablespoons of water to the pan."
