instructions: ["FOR THE FILLING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Combine sugar; cornstarch; and pepper, if using, in large bowl. Add strawberries and vanilla and mix gently with rubber spatula to combine. Transfer strawberry mixture to 13 by 9-inch baking dish or pan.","FOR THE TOPPING: Whisk flour, ¼ cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. Stir buttermilk and 6 tablespoons melted butter together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup (butter will clump; this is OK). Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated.","Using 2 large soupspoons, drop about twenty-four 1-inch-diameter portions of dough evenly over strawberry mixture. Brush tops of dough with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar.","Bake until bubbling, strawberry juice looks thick and syrupy, biscuits are golden brown, and toothpick inserted in center of biscuits comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cobbler cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Serve cobbler warm or at room temperature."]

notes: "We like how the sharp warmth of black pepper accentuates the strawberries fruitiness, but you can omit it for a more traditional flavor. We prefer the flavor of fresh strawberries here, but you can substitute frozen if fresh are unavailable; simply swap in 3 pounds of halved frozen strawberries (no need to thaw). If youre using a metal baking pan, the cobbler will likely be done at the beginning of the time range, but ovens and pans vary, so its important to follow visual cues. Serve with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or a drizzle of chilled heavy cream."
