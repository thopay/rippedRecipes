notes: "You can serve the chicken with lemon wedges, pitas, thinly sliced red onion, tomato, cucumber, torn fresh mint, and/or plain yogurt or tzatziki sauce, if desired. We recommend removing the lemon zest with a vegetable peeler. If you use wooden skewers, be sure to soak them in water for 20 minutes before using them."
