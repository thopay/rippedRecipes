description: "Caesar salad-the classic combination of romaine lettuce drizzled with a creamy dressing flavored with garlic, anchovy, Worcestershire, lemon, and Parmesan cheese and topped with seasoned croutons-was invented in Mexico, not Italy. We add a twist to bring this salad closer to its geographic roots."
