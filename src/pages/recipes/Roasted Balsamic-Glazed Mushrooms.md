notes: "Buy mushrooms with caps about 1½ inches in diameter; use any smaller mushrooms whole. Once you add the vinegar, watch carefully so the mushrooms don’t burn. If your microwave can’t fit the mushrooms in one batch, microwave them in two batches, decreasing the microwave time to 10 minutes per batch."
