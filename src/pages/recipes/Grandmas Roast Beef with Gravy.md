serves: 8
time: "3¾ to 4¾ hours, plus 1 hour salting"
instructions: ["SEASON MEAT Pat roast dry with paper towels and rub with 2 teaspoons salt. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.","BROWN ROAST Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 225 degrees. Pat roast dry with paper towels and rub with 2 teaspoons pepper. Heat oil in large ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown roast all over, 8 to 12 minutes; transfer to plate.","ROAST BEEF Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan. Add butter to skillet and melt over medium heat. Cook carrots, onion, and celery until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste and cook until flour is golden and paste begins to darken, about 2 minutes. Off heat, push vegetables to center of pan. Place roast on top of vegetable and transfer skillet to oven. Cook until meat registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Transfer roast to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest 20 minutes.","MAKE GRAVY Meanwhile, keeping in mind that handle will be hot, return skillet with vegetables to medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in consomme and water, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain gravy through fine-mesh strainer into serving bowl; discard vegetables. Season with salt and pepper.","CARVE Remove kitchen twine from roast. Thinly slice roast crosswise against grain. Serve with gravy."]

notes: "For even deeper seasoning, refrigerate the salt-rubbed roast for 24 hours. You can substitute top sirloin for the top round. Look for an evenly shaped roast with a 1/4-inch fat cap. Tie kitchen twine in 1-inch intervals around the circumference of the meat."
