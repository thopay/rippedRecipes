ingredients: ["2 1/4 cups (11¼ ounces), all-purpose flour","1 teaspoon, cream of tartar","1 teaspoon, baking soda","3/4 teaspoon, table salt","1 1/2 cups (10½ ounces), sugar, plus ⅓ cup for rolling","3 ounces, cream cheese, cut into 3 pieces","8 tablespoons, unsalted butter","1/4 cup, vegetable oil","1 , large egg","1 teaspoon, vanilla extract","1 tablespoon, ground cinnamon"]
serves: 24
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimless baking sheets with parchment paper.","Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt together in bowl; set aside. Place 1½ cups sugar and cream cheese in large heatproof bowl.","Melt butter in 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook, swirling skillet constantly, until milk solids in butter are color of milk chocolate and have toasty aroma, 3 to 5 minutes.","Immediately remove skillet from heat and scrape browned butter into bowl with sugar and cream cheese. Stir and mash with rubber spatula until combined. Whisk in oil. Whisk in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture with rubber spatula until soft, homogeneous dough forms.","Mix cinnamon and remaining ⅓ cup sugar together in shallow dish. Divide dough into 24 equal pieces, about 2 tablespoons each. Using your hands, roll dough into balls. Working in batches, roll balls in cinnamon sugar to coat, then evenly space balls on prepared sheets, 12 balls per sheet. Using bottom of drinking glass, flatten balls into 2-inch-wide disks, about ½ inch thick.","Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until puffed and covered with small cracks (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone; they will deflate and set as they cool), 11 to 13 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.","Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely. Serve. (Cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days.)","TO MAKE AHEAD: Follow recipe through step 5, then place dough disks on parchment paper–lined plate and freeze until very firm, at least 1 hour. Transfer disks to 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Increase baking time to about 15 minutes."]

notes: "When browning the butter in step 3, avoid using a nonstick skillet; the dark color of the skillet’s nonstick coating makes it difficult to gauge when the butter has correctly browned. The cream cheese doesn’t have to be at room temperature for this recipe; pouring the hot butter over it in step 4 will soften it enough to make it easy to mix. The final dough will be slightly softer than most cookie doughs. Trust the times in the recipe and don’t overbake the cookies. They may seem underbaked when you pull them from the oven, but they will deflate and set as they cool."
