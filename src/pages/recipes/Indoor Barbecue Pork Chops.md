time: "40 minutes"
instructions: ["Combine 1 tablespoon sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, and cayenne in bowl. Transfer 2 tablespoons spice mixture to second bowl and stir in cornstarch; reserve remaining spice mixture for sauce. Using kitchen shears, snip through fat surrounding loin muscle of each chop in 2 places, about 2 inches apart. Pat chops dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with cornstarch mixture.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add 4 chops to skillet and cook until browned and meat registers 140 degrees, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chops to rimmed baking sheet and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining 4 chops.","Add butter to now-empty skillet and melt over medium heat. Add reserved spice mixture and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Carefully whisk in ketchup, vinegar, liquid smoke, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar; bring to simmer; and remove from heat. Return chops to skillet one at a time, turn to coat with sauce, and transfer to platter. Stir any accumulated juices from sheet into remaining sauce. Serve chops, passing remaining sauce separately."]

notes: "Be sure to use kosher salt and unsalted butter in this recipe or the dish will be too salty. Thinner pork chops, such as the ½-inch-thick chops we call for here, can buckle during cooking, which will cause them to cook unevenly. To prevent this, we use kitchen shears to snip the fat surrounding the loin portion of each chop. We recommend using a liquid smoke product that contains just water and smoke, such as Wrights Liquid Smoke."
