description: "The crust split. Blueberries burned on the oven floor. The soupy filling required a spoon to eat. How could freezing an unbaked pie cause so much aggravation?"

ingredients: ["1 recipe, Double-Crust Pie Dough (see note)","4 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted","4 whole, graham crackers, crushed to fine crumbs","30 ounces (6 cups), blueberries","1 1/4 cups, dried cranberries","3/4 cup (5¼ ounces), sugar","2 tablespoons, Minute tapioca","2 teaspoons, lemon juice","1/4 teaspoon, salt"]
serves: 8
time: "2½ hours, plus 1 hour freezing and 2 hours cooling"
instructions: ["PREPARE CRUSTS On lightly floured surface, roll 1 dough into 12-inch circle (if using store-bought dough, you do not need to roll either crust). Transfer to 9-inch pie plate. Brush crust with 2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with half of cracker crumbs. Cover with plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes. Roll second dough into 12-inch circle and brush with remaining butter, leaving 1-inch border around edge. Refrigerate, covered, on large plate for 30 minutes.","MAKING FILLING Heat 4 cups blueberries and cranberries in saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally and mashing slightly, until blueberries break down and mixture is thickened, 8 to 10 minutes (mixture should measure 1 1/4 cups). Let cool slightly, then stir in sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, salt, and remaining blueberries. Refrigerate until cool, about 15 minutes.","ASSEMBLE PIE Transfer filling to dough-lined pie plate. Sprinkle remaining cracker crumbs over filling. Following photo 2 of the attached step by step \"A Crust That's Fit for the Freezer,\" fold lip of bottom crust inward over filling. Brush border of dough with water, then arrange top crust, buttered-side down, over pie. Crimp edges of pie. Cut six 1-inch slits about 1 inch from crust and four 1-inch slits near center of pie. Allow pie to firm in freezer for 1 hour. Once pie is firm, wrap it tightly with plastic, then aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months.","BAKE PIE Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake until juices are bubbling and crust is golden brown, about 80 minutes. Let cool on wire rack at least 2 hours. Serve."]

notes: "Both fresh and frozen berries will work, but frozen berries will need to cook a few minutes longer in step 2. Use our Double-Crust Pie Dough recipe (related), or use one 15-ounce box Pillsbury Just Unroll! pie crust."
