Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, 5 to 6 hours on high, or 6 to 7 hours on low.","Puree soup with immersion blender until smooth, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, puree soup in batches in blender until smooth; transfer to Dutch oven and keep warm over low heat.) Whisk cheddar into soup until melted.

notes: "The easiest way to puree this soup is with an immersion blender. Our favorite model is the KitchenAid 3-Speed hand Blender. If using a standard blender, let the soup cool for 5 minutes before pureeing. Puree in batches, holding lid in place with a dish towel. Buy large potatoes so there are fewer to peel."
