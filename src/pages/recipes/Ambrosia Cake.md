notes: "Ambrosia, food of the gods in Greek and Roman mythology, is something a bit more humble in most American households, where its better known as a chilled fruit salad, often made with mandarin oranges, pineapple, and coconut. The tall and tropical ambrosia cake, made with angel food cake, pineapple curd, and orange and vanilla frostings, has more heavenly aspirations."
