While whisking, pour boiling water in slow, steady stream into 1/3 cup cornmeal, followed by buttermilk, Tabasco, and egg. Pour wet mixture into dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Mix in cooked peppers and cheese.","Carefully remove skillet from oven and quickly pour batter into heated skillet. Bake until light golden brown, about 10 minutes.

notes: "The texture of the cornbread will vary according to your cornmeal. Very fine-grained meal will result in a dense, uniform texture, while coarser-grained meal will have a bit more bite. The stone-ground cornmeal typically sold in supermarkets is the best choice."
