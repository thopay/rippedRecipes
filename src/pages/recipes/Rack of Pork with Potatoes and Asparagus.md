Wrap roast in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in bowl, then arrange cut side down in large roasting pan.","Nestle V-rack among potatoes in pan. Unwrap roast and brush off any excess sugar mixture. Sprinkle roast with 1 teaspoon pepper and place fat side up on V-rack.","Roast until center of pork registers 130 degrees, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer pork and V-rack to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 minutes.","Meanwhile, toss asparagus with remaining 2 teaspoons oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in bowl and place on top of potatoes.

notes: "Use small Yukon Gold potatoes measuring 1 to 2 inches in diameter. The roast’s bones trap heat, so the meat continues to cook during the resting period, which is why we pull it from the oven at 130 degrees; the temperature will climb to 145 degrees. Monitoring the roast with a probe thermometer is best. If you use an instant-read thermometer, open the oven door as infrequently as possible and remove the roast from the oven before taking its temperature. Serve with Quick Salsa Verde (recipe follows)."
