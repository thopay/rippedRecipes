ingredients: ["1 1/2 tablespoons, kosher salt","1 1/2 teaspoon, pepper","1/4 teaspoon, cayenne pepper","1 (5-pound), boneless beef chuck-eye roast, trimmed","2 cups, wood chips"]
serves: 10
time: "2¾ hours, plus 18 hours brining and 20 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Combine salt, pepper, and cayenne in bowl. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Place roast on large sheet of plastic wrap and rub all over with spice mixture. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours.","Just before grilling, soak wood chips in water for 15 minutes, then drain. Using large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in 8 by 4 1/2-inch foil packet. (Make sure chips do not poke holes in sides or bottom of packet.) Cut 2 evenly spaced 2-inch slits in top of packet.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Remove cooking grate and place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Set cooking grate in place, turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner [or, if using three-burner grill, primary burner and second burner] as needed to maintain grill temperature of 350 degrees.)","Clean and oil cooking grate. Place roast on cooler side of grill. Cover grill (positioning lid vent directly over roast if using charcoal) and cook until meat registers 155 to 160 degrees, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Transfer roast to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Slice thin and serve."]
