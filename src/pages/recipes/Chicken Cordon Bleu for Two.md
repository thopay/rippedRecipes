serves: 2
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Toss panko with melted butter, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan until combined. Bake until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through baking. Let cool completely.","Roll each piece of Gruyere in 1 slice of ham, folding edges of ham over so no cheese is exposed. Using sharp knife, cut each chicken breast in half horizontally into 2 equal-size cutlets. Season chicken with salt and pepper and spread 1 teaspoon mustard evenly on cut side of each cutlet. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, place 1 ham-and-­Gruyere roll 1 inch from thick end of mustard side of cutlet and roll up tightly. Secure each chicken roll with toothpick and set aside, seam side down.","Brush tops of chicken rolls with egg and dip into panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Discard remaining panko mixture. Arrange chicken rolls, crumb side up, in now-empty loaf pan. Bake until chicken registers 160 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating pan halfway through cooking. Remove toothpicks and serve."]

notes: "This recipe is best with ham slices with some heft. To prevent the cheese from oozing out, completely enclose it inside each ham slice."
