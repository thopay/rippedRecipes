serves: 6
time: "1½ hours, plus 3 hours chilling"
instructions: ["FOR THE CROQUETTES: Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and salt and cook until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.","Stir in ½ cup flour until no dry flour remains; cook for 1 minute, stirring often. Slowly whisk in milk; continue to whisk 1 minute longer to ensure no lumps of flour remain. Cook until bubbles begin to break surface and mixture is thickened to consistency of paste, 1 to 2 minutes.","Off heat, stir in crab, scallions, Tabasco, Creole seasoning, and pepper until well combined. Transfer to 8-inch square baking dish and refrigerate, uncovered, until fully chilled and firm, about 3 hours (or cover with plastic wrap once cooled completely and refrigerate overnight).","FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE: Whisk mayonnaise, Tabasco, and Worcestershire together in bowl; refrigerate until ready to serve.","Place remaining ½ cup flour in shallow dish, beat eggs together in second shallow dish, and place panko in third shallow dish. Divide croquette mixture into 18 heaping 2-tablespoon portions (about 1½ ounces each) and place on rimmed baking sheet. Roll portions between your hands to make balls, then shape into 2-inch-long ovals.","Working with few croquettes at a time, dredge lightly in flour, shaking off excess; roll in beaten egg, allowing excess to drip off; and coat with panko. Return to sheet. (Croquettes can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 3 hours.)","Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Place 9 croquettes in oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared plate. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining 9 croquettes. Sprinkle lightly with extra Creole seasoning and serve with dipping sauce."]

notes: "If you can find and afford fresh crabmeat, the crab croquettes will be better. However, refrigerated canned crabmeat, often found at the supermarket fish counter, is the next best thing."
