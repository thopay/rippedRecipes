Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook pork until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes; transfer pork to prepared wire rack. Roast until meat registers 140 degrees, 14 to 18 minutes. Transfer to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.","Meanwhile, add shallot to now-empty skillet and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add port, vinegar, cherries, and thyme sprig and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Off heat, discard thyme sprig and whisk in butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice pork, transfer to platter, and pour sauce over top. Serve."]
