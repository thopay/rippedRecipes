serves: 4
time: "45 minutes"
instructions: ["Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large Dutch oven. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve ½ cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot.","Meanwhile, slice guanciale into ¼-inch-thick strips, then cut each strip crosswise into ¼-inch pieces. Add oil, onion, pepper flakes, and guanciale to large saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fat is rendered and guanciale and onion just begin to brown, about 7 minutes. Add wine and cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes and their juice and salt and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.","Add Pecorino, sauce, and ¼ cup reserved cooking water to pasta and toss until sauce looks glossy and evenly coats pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed. Serve, passing extra Pecorino separately."]

notes: "We call for Pecorino Romano here, but Parmesan can be used, if preferred. You can substitute pancetta for the guanciale; just be sure to buy a 4-ounce hunk and not presliced pancetta."
