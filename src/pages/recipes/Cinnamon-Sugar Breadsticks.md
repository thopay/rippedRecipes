notes: "If possible, buy bagged pizza dough that is still partially frozen; the yeast is more likely to be active, which will give the breadsticks a better rise during baking. Its important to let the dough come to room temperature before beginning the recipe. Do not use Pillsbury Pizza Crust here."
