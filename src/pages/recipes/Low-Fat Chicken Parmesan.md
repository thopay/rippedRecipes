Off heat, stir in basil and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.","For the chicken: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add bread crumbs and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Let cool, then stir in Parmesan and salt; transfer to shallow dish.","Spray wire rack with cooking spray and set inside rimmed baking sheet. Following photos 1 and 2 at right, spread mayonnaise over top of cutlets and dip into crumb mixture. Arrange crumb-side up on prepared rack and mist with cooking spray. Bake until crumbs are dark golden brown, about 8 minutes.","Top each cutlet with 1/4 cup marinara and 1 slice mozzarella. Bake until cheese has melted and chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Spoon 1/4 cup marinara evenly over each plate and top with chicken. Serve, passing remaining sauce at table."]
