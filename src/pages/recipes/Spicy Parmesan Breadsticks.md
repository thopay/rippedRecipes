Roll and stretch 1 piece of dough into 9 by 5-inch rectangle on lightly floured counter. Transfer dough to half of prepared sheet, with short ends parallel to long sides of sheet. Repeat with remaining dough piece and place on other half of sheet.","Combine Parmesan, granulated garlic, pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in bowl. Using pastry brush, brush doughs with half of melted butter. Sprinkle doughs with half of Parmesan mixture. Flip doughs, brush with remaining melted butter, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan mixture.","Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut through doughs crosswise at 1-inch intervals to create nine 5-inch breadsticks on each piece of dough, but do not separate breadsticks.

notes: "If possible, buy bagged pizza dough that is still partially frozen; the yeast is more likely to be active, which will give the breadsticks a better rise during baking. Its important to let the dough come to room temperature before beginning the recipe. Do not use Pillsbury Pizza Crust here."
