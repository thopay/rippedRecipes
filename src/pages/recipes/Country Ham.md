ingredients: ["13 - 15 pound, country ham, 3-6 months old, bone-in","1/2 cup, packed light brown sugar","1 tablespoon, dry mustard","2 teaspoons, pepper"]
serves: 15
time: "4½ to 5½ hours, plus 20 minutes resting"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Using clean, stiff-bristled brush, scrub ham under cold running water to remove any surface mold. Transfer ham to cutting board and trim off dry meat, skin, and all but 1/4 inch of fat. Score fat cap in 1/2-inch crosshatch pattern, 1/4 inch deep.","Transfer ham to roasting pan fat side up, add 1 quart water, and cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Bake until thickest part of meat registers 140 degrees, 4 to 5 hours. Remove ham from oven, discard foil, and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.","Combine sugar, mustard, and pepper in bowl and rub over top of ham. Return ham to oven and cook, uncovered, until glazed, 12 to 17 minutes. Transfer ham to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes. Carve thin slices and serve."]

notes: "Use hams aged six months or less for this recipe. Mold on country ham is not a sign of spoilage; it is a natural effect of the curing and aging process. Serve ham on biscuits with Jezebel Sauce (see related recipe). Leftover ham is delicious in scrambled eggs, cheese grits, macaroni and cheese, and all manner of things."
