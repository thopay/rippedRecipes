notes: "If you dont have a shredding disk for your food processor, shred the carrots on the large holes of a box grater. If youre spice averse, use only one chile and consider halving the chile and removing the ribs and seeds. We recommend wearing rubber gloves when handling the chiles. Brown sugar can be substituted for the granulated sugar."
