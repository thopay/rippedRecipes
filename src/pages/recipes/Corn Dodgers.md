description: "These easy-to-make cornmeal cakes were popular with Civil War soldiers and pioneers heading West. Unfortunately, most recipes yield dense, gritty, and hard-as-a-brick cakes. We wanted to bring this corn bread into the 21st century and improve both flavor and texture."

instructions: ["For the corn dodgers: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spread oil on rimmed baking sheet.","Whisk cornmeal, sugar, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Heat water, buttermilk, and butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat until just simmering. In slow, steady stream, whisk cornmeal mixture into liquid. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until mixture begins to bubble, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and cool until warm, about 10 minutes.","Whisk baking powder and egg in small bowl, then stir into cornmeal mixture. Fill medium bowl with tap water. Scoop out 1/4 cup mixture and, using wet hands, form into 4 by 1 1/2-inch loaf shape. Place on prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining mixture, spacing dodgers about 1/2 inch apart. Bake until deep brown on bottom and golden brown on top, rotating pan halfway through baking, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer corn dodgers to rack to cool.","For the honey butter: Meanwhile, mix all ingredients in medium bowl until smooth. Serve corn dodgers, split open, with honey butter. (Corn dodgers can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; reheat on baking sheet in 350-degree oven.)"]

notes: "Corn dodgers go great with fried chicken, catfish, chili, or barbecue. The honey butter is an optional (but great) final touch. Maple butter and maple syrup are other traditional accompaniments."
