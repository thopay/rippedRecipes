instructions: ["SCORE AND SEASON Score ham at 1-inch intervals in crosshatch pattern. Combine sugar, paprika, pepper, and cayenne in small bowl. Rub spice mixture all over ham. Transfer to V-rack and let stand at room temperature 1½ hours. Thread ham with metal skewers on both sides of the bone.","ROAST HAM Heat all burners on high for 15 minutes, then leave primary burner on high and turn other burner(s) off. (For charcoal grill, open bottom vent on grill. Light 100 coals; when covered with fine gray ash, spread over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place and heat covered, with lid vent open halfway, for 5 minutes.) Scrape cooking grate. Arrange V-rack over cooler side of grill. Cook ham, covered, until meat registers 100 degrees, about 1½ hours.","CRISP HAM Turn all burners to low. (For charcoal grill, light about 25 coals. When coals are covered with fine gray ash, remove grill grate and scatter over top of spent coals. Replace grill grate and position V-rack directly over coals.) Grill ham until lightly charred on all sides, about 30 minutes, turning ham every 5 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 15 minutes. Carve and serve."]

notes: "Do not use a spiral sliced ham; it will dry out on the grill. You will need two 12-inch metal skewers for this recipe."
