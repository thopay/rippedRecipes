time: "5 hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine onion powder, flour, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, thyme, and celery seeds in bowl.","Pat roast dry with paper towels. Using 3 pieces of kitchen twine, tie roast around circumference at equal intervals. Place roast in oven bag and sprinkle with spice mixture on all sides. Add potatoes, carrots, and water to bag. Tie bag closed with kitchen twine.","Place bag in 13 by 9-inch ceramic baking dish. Cut two 1/2-inch slits in top of bag. Transfer dish to oven and bake until paring knife inserted through top of bag slips easily in and out of beef, about 4 hours.","Remove dish from oven. Carefully cut open bag just above contents so steam releases away from you. Using tongs, transfer roast to carving board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.","Carefully lift bag so vegetables and braising liquid pour into baking dish; discard bag. Push vegetables to 1 side of dish. Gently tilt dish (it will be hot) to allow braising liquid to pool on opposite side; skim 1/4 cup fat from surface using large spoon.","Discard twine and slice beef 1/4 inch thick. Transfer beef to dish with vegetables and baste with braising liquid. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve."]

notes: "You will need a nylon oven bag that can hold up to 8 pounds. Make sure the bag does not touch the top or sides of the oven, or it will melt. We prefer to use a ceramic, not Pyrex, baking dish, because adding liquid to a hot Pyrex dish can sometimes shock it and cause cracking."
