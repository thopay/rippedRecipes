Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until berries break down and mixture is thick and jam-like, about 10 minutes (mixture should measure ½ cup). Transfer jam to bowl, stir in zest, and cool to room temperature.","PROCESS DOUGH Pulse flour, baking powder, salt, additional ⅓ cup sugar, and all but 1 tablespoon butter in food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer to large bowl and stir in milk until combined.","SHAPE DOUGH Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 8 to 10 times. Pat dough into 6-inch square, wrap with plastic, and freeze until just firm, about 20 minutes. Following photos 1 to 4 at left, roll dough into 12- by 10-inch rectangle, spread with jam, roll into tight cylinder, and arrange seam-down on prepared baking sheet.","BAKE Melt remaining butter and brush over dough. Sprinkle with remaining sugar and bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on sheet, then transfer to wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.","MAKE AHEAD Roly poly can be prepared through step 3, then covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated on prepared baking sheet for 24 hours. To serve, remove plastic wrap and proceed with step 4, increasing baking time to 50 minutes."]

notes: "Both fresh and frozen blackberries will work. Like a biscuit, roly poly tastes best on the day its baked. Use a serrated knife to slice it."
