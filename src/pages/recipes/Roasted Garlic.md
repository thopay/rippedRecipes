Drizzle garlic with oil and sprinkle with salt. Pull sides of foil up around garlic while keeping garlic heads in single layer and crimp tightly to seal.","Transfer sheet to oven and roast until garlic is soft, about 1½ hours.","Remove sheet from oven and let garlic cool in foil on rack for 30 minutes. To use, squeeze head from root end to extrude garlic; discard skins.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Place whole heads of roasted garlic in airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
