serves: 12
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Cook bacon in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crispy, 7 to 9 minutes; transfer to paper towel–lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Process flour, potato flakes, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt, and bacon in food processor until combined, about 15 seconds. Add chilled butter and shortening and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, 7 to 9 pulses.","Transfer flour mixture to large bowl. Stir in buttermilk with rubber spatula until combined, turning and pressing until no dry flour remains. Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface and knead briefly, 8 to 10 times, to form smooth, cohesive ball. Roll out dough into 9-inch circle, about 3/4 inch thick.","Using floured 2 1/2-inch round cutter, stamp out 8 to 9 biscuits and arrange upside down on prepared sheet. Gather dough scraps and gently pat into 3/4-inch-thick circle. Stamp out remaining 3 to 4 biscuits and transfer to sheet.","Bake until biscuits begin to rise, about 5 minutes, then rotate sheet and reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees. Continue to bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes longer. Brush biscuit tops with melted butter. Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before serving."]

notes: "We like the texture of biscuits made with both butter and shortening, but if you prefer to use all butter, omit the shortening and use 12 tablespoons of chilled butter in step 2."
