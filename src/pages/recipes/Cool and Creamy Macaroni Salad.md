description: "Macaroni salad should wrap pasta elbows and chopped celery and onion in a creamy dressing. Yet most are dry and bland. We wanted a creamy macaroni salad that stayed that way."

notes: "Don’t drain the macaroni too well before adding the other ingredients--a little extra moisture will keep the salad from drying out. If you’ve made the salad ahead of time, simply stir in a little warm water to loosen the texture."
