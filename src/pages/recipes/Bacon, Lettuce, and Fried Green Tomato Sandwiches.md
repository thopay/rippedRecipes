serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours, plus 1 hour salting"
instructions: ["Core tomatoes and cut off rounded top and bottom. Slice tomatoes into twelve ⅛- to ¼-inch-thick slices (you may have some left over). Line rimmed baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Place tomatoes on prepared sheet and sprinkle both sides with sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover tomatoes with triple layer of paper towels and let sit for 1 hour.","Meanwhile, whisk mayonnaise and Tabasco together in bowl; set aside.","Whisk flour, panko, Old Bay, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt together in large bowl. Beat eggs together in shallow dish. Remove top layer of paper towels from tomatoes. Transfer tomatoes to flour mixture and toss to coat.","Remove remaining paper towels from sheet and wipe sheet dry. Return tomatoes to now-empty sheet. Working with 1 slice at a time, dip tomatoes in egg, allowing excess to drip off, and return to flour mixture, pressing firmly so coating adheres. Return tomatoes to sheet.","Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels. Add oil to 12-inch nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Fry half of tomatoes until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per side, reducing heat as needed if oil gets too hot. Using tongs, transfer fried tomatoes to prepared plate. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining tomatoes.","Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise mixture on each roll bottom, then follow with 6 half-slices bacon and 3 fried tomatoes, overlapping slightly in center. Toss lettuce with remaining ¼ cup mayonnaise mixture in bowl and divide evenly among sandwiches. Cover with roll tops and serve."]

notes: "Look for green tomatoes that are about 3 inches in diameter. Its best to slice the tomatoes closer to ⅛ inch thick if possible, but as long as theyre less than ¼ inch thick they will work well in this sandwich."
