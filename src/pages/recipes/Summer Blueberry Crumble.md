serves: 6
time: "55 minutes, plus 30 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add berries to bowl and toss to coat. Transfer to 8-inch square baking dish.","Process flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and remaining salt in food processor until combined. Add butter and pulse until dime-sized clumps form. Transfer crumble to bowl and pinch together any powdery parts. Sprinkle crumble evenly over berries.","Bake until filling is bubbling around edges and topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Serve. (Once fully cooled, the crumble can be wrapped with plastic and refrigerated for 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.)","Crumble Without a Food Processor: In step 2, mix flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add chilled butter to bowl and, using pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into dry ingredients until dime-sized clumps form. Pinch together any powdery parts, then sprinkle crumble evenly over berries. Proceed with recipe as directed."]

notes: "Avoid instant or quick oats here—they are too soft and will make the crumble mushy. In step 2, do not press the topping into the berry mixture or it may sink and become soggy. Frozen berries do not work in this recipe because they shed too much liquid. Serve with vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream."
