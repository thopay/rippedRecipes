instructions: ["FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, and flour pans. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in bowl. In second bowl, whisk boiling water, chocolate, cocoa, and espresso powder until smooth.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined. Add sour cream and vanilla and mix until incorporated.","Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with chocolate mixture in 2 additions, scraping down bowl as needed. Give batter final stir by hand.","Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops with rubber spatula. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking.","Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans, discarding parchment, and let cool completely on rack, about 2 hours.","FOR THE CHEESECAKE: Sprinkle gelatin over Kahlua in small saucepan and let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Cook gelatin mixture over low heat until edges are just bubbling. Add chocolate and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until just melted and smooth, about 2 minutes longer. Set aside and let cool for 15 minutes.","Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes; transfer to medium bowl and set aside. Fit now-empty stand mixer with paddle and beat cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-low, add cooled chocolate mixture, and beat until just combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in whipped cream until combined.","Set 1 cake round in 9-inch springform pan. Spread cheesecake mixture over cake in pan in even layer. Place remaining cake round on top of cheesecake mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 6 hours. Run thin knife between cake and side of pan; remove side of pan. Transfer cake to cake stand or plate. Run offset spatula around cake sides to smooth cheesecake flush with cake.","FOR THE FROSTING: Process butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt in food processor until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. (Frosting can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 hours.)","Fit 3 pastry bags with small star tips. Transfer ½ cup vanilla frosting to 1 pastry bag. Whisk melted bittersweet chocolate into remaining frosting in bowl until fully combined. Transfer 2½ cups chocolate frosting to second pastry bag. Whisk cocoa into remaining chocolate frosting in bowl until fully combined, then transfer to third pastry bag. (You will have 2 shades of chocolate frosting: light and dark.)","Cover sides of cake with stars of light chocolate frosting. Pipe bull's-eye pattern of stars over top of cake, starting with dark chocolate frosting at edge and alternating colors with each row. Refrigerate until frosting is firm, about 45 minutes. Serve."]
