notes: "We prefer the thick texture of Greek yogurt to the thinner texture of regular yogurt for this recipe. Our favorite hummus, from Sabra, comes in a 17-ounce family size; two of these containers will equal 4¼ cups. For added flavor, you can substitute store-bought tzatziki sauce for the yogurt. For best results, be sure to assemble this dip shortly before serving, because it doesn’t store well. Serve the dip with pita chips or sliced vegetables."
