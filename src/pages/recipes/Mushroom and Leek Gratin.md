notes: "Leeks come in a variety of sizes. If possible, purchase ones that have more white than green. If you can find only predominately green leeks, then buy closer to 5 pounds of leeks to ensure that you have enough to yield the 10 cups of sliced leeks needed for this recipe. To make vegetarian: You can substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth, if desired."
