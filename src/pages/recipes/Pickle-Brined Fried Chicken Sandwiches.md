Add remaining ¼ cup pickle brine to flour mixture and rub between your fingers until tiny craggy bits form throughout.","Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, remove chicken from brine and transfer to flour mixture. Using your hands, toss chicken in flour mixture, pressing on coating to adhere and breaking up clumps, until coated on all sides. Transfer chicken to prepared wire rack. Discard brine. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.","Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Carefully add chicken and fry until chicken is golden brown and registers at least 175 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through frying.
