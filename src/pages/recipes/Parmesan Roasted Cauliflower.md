notes: "You will need to purchase 3 pounds of whole cauliflower (one to two heads) to yield 2 pounds of florets. You can also use precut cauliflower florets. For the best results, we recommend using freshly grated Parmesan cheese; use a rasp-style grater to grate the Parmesan. If using canned Parmesan, omit the salt and season with salt and pepper to taste before serving."
