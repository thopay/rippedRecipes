instructions: ["FOR THE TURKEY: Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Dry turkey thoroughly inside and out with paper towels. Tuck wings under turkey and transfer to prepared wire rack. Pull legs upward and slide 12-inch skewer under bone of fattest part of drumstick across to other drumstick so skewer connects both and legs cover small point of breast.","Combine thyme, rosemary, sage, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika in bowl. Rub 2 tablespoons spice mixture evenly over surface of turkey and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Add mayonnaise, oil, and vinegar to remaining spice mixture and whisk to combine. Divide mayonnaise mixture in half.","Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Brush half of mayonnaise mixture evenly over surface of turkey. Place 18 by 18-inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil diagonally over breast, tucking point of foil inside cavity and over tops of legs. Transfer turkey to oven and pour water into bottom of baking sheet. Roast until thighs/drumsticks register 165 degrees, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove turkey from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.","FOR THE GRAVY: While turkey cooks, melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery and cook until well browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in 2 cups water, broth, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until mixture has thickened, about 20 minutes (gravy will be very thick). Remove from heat and set aside.","Once oven has come to temperature, remove foil and brush remaining half of mayonnaise mixture evenly over turkey. Return turkey to oven and roast until breasts register 160 degrees and thighs/drumsticks register 175 degrees, 25 to 35 minutes. Tip juices from turkey cavity into baking sheet and transfer turkey to carving board. Let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes.","Remove wire rack from baking sheet. Pour remaining 1 1/2 cups water into baking sheet and scrape up any browned bits. Carefully pour pan juices into fat separator and let sit for 5 minutes. Pour defatted pan juices into gravy and bring to simmer over medium heat. Simmer until gravy is thickened and reduced to 3 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain gravy through fine-mesh strainer into clean saucepan; discard solids. Rewarm gravy gently over medium-low heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Carve turkey and serve with gravy."]

notes: "We like Butterball Frozen Turkeys for this recipe. If you prefer natural, unenhanced turkey, we recommend brining. You will need a 12-inch skewer for this recipe."
