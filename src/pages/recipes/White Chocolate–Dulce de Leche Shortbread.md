instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine almonds and ¼ cup sugar in small bowl; set aside.","Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour, butter, orange zest, vanilla, almond extract, and remaining ½ cup sugar on low speed until dough forms, about 4 minutes. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.","Working with 1 piece at a time, roll dough into 12 by 8-inch rectangle on lightly floured counter. Brush dough with one-third of egg white, then sprinkle with one-third of almond mixture. Using fluted pastry wheel, cut dough into sixteen 3 by 2-inch rectangles. Repeat with remaining dough pieces, egg white, and almond mixture.","Space cookies ½ inch apart on prepared sheets, 12 cookies per sheet. Bake until golden around edges, 15 to 20 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Let cookies cool completely before frosting. Repeat with remaining dough and cooled sheets.","Microwave chocolate in bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, 1½ to 2 minutes. Using fork, drizzle chocolate over cookies. Microwave dulce de leche until pourable, about 30 seconds. Drizzle over cookies. Let chocolate and dulce de leche set, about 30 minutes, before serving. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 week.)"]

notes: "White chocolate can seize easily; take care not to overheat it. A rasp grater is our favorite tool for zesting oranges (and other citrus). Look for dulce de leche in the international or baking aisle of your grocery store."
