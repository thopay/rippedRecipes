serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Combine berbere, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt in small bowl to make spice paste. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Rub spice paste over entire surface of chicken. Tuck wingtips behind back.","Using highest saute or browning function, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in Instant Pot for 5 minutes (or until just smoking). Place chicken, breast side down, in pot and cook until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Using tongs, remove chicken from pot.","Create aluminum foil sling by folding large sheet of foil into 19 by 6-inch rectangle. Place chicken, breast side up, crosswise in center of sling. Lift sides of sling and lower chicken into pot, allowing narrow edges of sling to rest along sides of insert. Add water to pot.","Lock lid into place and close pressure-release valve. Select high pressure-cook function and cook for 30 minutes.","Turn off Instant Pot, then quick-release pressure. Carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Using sling, carefully transfer chicken to carving board, allowing excess liquid to drain back into pot. Let rest for 15 minutes.","Using wide spoon, skim fat from surface of jus in pot. Carve chicken and transfer to shallow platter. Drizzle ¼ cup jus over chicken. Serve, passing remaining jus separately."]

notes: "Once cooked, the chicken will be very tender; we call for an aluminum foil sling to make it easier to remove it from the Instant Pot. If your Instant Pot comes with a steamer rack with handles, you can use it instead of the foil sling. Berbere is a warmly aromatic and highly flavorful Ethiopian and Eritrean spice blend often found in grocery store spice sections. Its potency can vary from brand to brand, so if youre spice averse, feel free to use less than the amount called for."
