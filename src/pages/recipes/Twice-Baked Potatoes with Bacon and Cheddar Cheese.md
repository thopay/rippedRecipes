time: "2½ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Prick each potato lightly with fork in 6 places. Dissolve 1 tablespoon salt in ½ cup water in large bowl. Add potatoes and toss so exteriors are evenly moistened. Place potatoes on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until centers register 205 degrees, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let potatoes cool for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees.","While potatoes bake, cook bacon in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate; set aside. Discard fat in skillet or reserve for another use. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.","With potatoes sitting on flat sides, cut off top ¼ inch and discard. Using fork, carefully remove potato flesh from remaining portion of potato by poking and twisting at insides to loosen, leaving ¼-inch wall all around inside of potato. Transfer potato flesh to medium bowl. Set aside potato shells.","Using potato masher, mash potato flesh until smooth. Stir in 3 tablespoons melted butter, sour cream, pepper, and salt until incorporated. Stir in cheddar, scallions, and bacon until combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.","Divide filling evenly among potato shells (scant ¾ cup each), mounding filling over tops of potatoes. Fluff up top of filling with tines of fork. Brush 1 tablespoon melted butter in now-empty skillet and place potatoes in skillet. Brush remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter over tops of potatoes.","Bake until potatoes are warmed through and beginning to brown on top, 20 to 23 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.","TO MAKE AHEAD: At the end of step 4, let potatoes cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. To serve, continue with step 5, increasing baking time by 10 minutes."]

notes: "Try to find potatoes of equal size and weight to ensure even cooking. Larger potatoes will work, but the baking time in step 1 will be longer. This recipe can easily be doubled."
