Flatten dough balls to ¼-inch thickness with bottom of floured drinking glass.","Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until cookies are just set and lightly browned on bottom, 10 to 13 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheets, about 15 minutes.","Microwave chocolate in bowl at 50 percent power, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2 to 4 minutes. Carefully dip half of each cooled cookie in chocolate, scraping off excess with finger, and place on parchment paper–lined baking sheet.

notes: "Cape Cod 40% Reduced Fat Potato Chips is the test kitchen favorite among reduced-fat chips. In this recipe, they make for extremely crunchy cookies. To prevent sticking, dip the drinking glass in flour before flattening each cookie. Toast the pecans in a small, dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the skillet often, until they begin to darken, three to five minutes.&nbsp;"
