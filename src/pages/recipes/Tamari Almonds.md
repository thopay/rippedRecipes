notes: "Although this recipe requires more effort than others for tamari almonds (the almonds get bathed in a seasoned tamari mixture four times), the flavor penetrates, yielding especially tasty nuts. Be sure to use low-sodium tamari or the nuts will be too salty. Tamari is a darker, thicker version of soy sauce that is traditionally made without wheat.&nbsp;"
