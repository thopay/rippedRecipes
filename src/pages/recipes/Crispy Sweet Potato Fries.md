description: "Most sweet potatoes turn soggy seconds after emerging from the hot oil. To stay crisp, sweet potatoes need to be treated differently from regular potatoes."

ingredients: ["1/2 teaspoon, chili powder","1/2 teaspoon, garlic powder","1/2 teaspoon, cayenne pepper","1 teaspoon, salt","2 quarts, peanut or vegetable oil","1 cup, cornstarch","3/4 cup, club soda, chilled","2 pounds, sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2- by 1/4-inch lengths"]
serves: 4
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Combine chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne, and salt in large bowl.","Heat oil in large Dutch oven over high heat to 375 degrees. While oil is heating, whisk cornstarch and club soda in medium bowl. Working in small batches, dip sweet potatoes in cornstarch mixture, allowing excess to drip back into bowl, and transfer to wire rack.","When oil is ready, fry half of sweet potatoes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain fries on paper towel-lined baking sheet and transfer to oven. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining fries. Transfer crisp fries to bowl with spice mixture and toss to coat. Serve.","Make Ahead: In step 2, the coated sweet potatoes can be frozen on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet until just set, about 15 minutes, then transferred to a zipper-lock bag and kept frozen for up to 1 month. When ready to serve, proceed with step 3 (the fries might take a minute or two more to become golden brown and crisp)."]

notes: "To prevent the sweet potatoes from turning brown, do not cut them until ready to use. In step 2, place a layer of paper towels under the wire rack to collect any drippings; alternatively, place the wire rack over the sink. The sweet potatoes are fried in two batches to prevent overcrowding the pot, which can lead to a reduction in oil temperature and uneven cooking."
