Melt chocolate and combine with chocolate syrup in a small bowl, set aside. Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl.","Place butter in large bowl and beat with electric mixer at medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add sugar and continue to beat until well incorporated, 1 minute longer, stopping mixer as necessary to scrape down bowl. Add melted chocolate mixture and beat until mixture looks thick and grainy, about 1 minute. Add eggs, vanilla, and instant coffee. Beat at medium-high until fluffy and pale brown, 2 minutes. With mixer on low, add one-third flour mixture, followed by half of buttermilk. Repeat, ending with flour mixture. Scrape down bowl, increase speed to medium, and beat until creamy and without lumps, about 30 seconds. Give batter final stir.","Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Bake until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out with a few crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on wire rack 20 minutes. Run knife around pan perimeter to loosen. Invert cake onto second rack, peel off parchment, and reinvert onto lightly greased rack. Cool completely (at least 1 hour), frost cake, and serve."]
