serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Toss potatoes with oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper on prepared sheet and spread into even layer. Bake until potatoes are spotty brown on tops and sides, about 20 minutes.","Meanwhile, spread 1 side of bread slices evenly with 2 tablespoons butter. Using 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or sturdy drinking glass of similar diameter, cut circle from center of each bread slice; reserve cut-out bread rounds.","Remove sheet from oven. Distribute sausages over potatoes (it’s OK if some fall onto sheet), return sheet to oven, and bake until sausages are lightly browned on top, about 12 minutes.","Remove sheet from oven. Using metal spatula, push potatoes and sausages into pile occupying about one-third of sheet, creating enough room for bread. Place remaining 1 tablespoon butter on now-empty part of sheet and use spatula to distribute evenly. Place all bread, buttered side up, on empty part of sheet (do not place cut-out bread rounds in holes). Bake until bread is lightly toasted on bottom, about 4 minutes.","Remove sheet from oven. Flip bread. Crack 1 egg into each bread hole and season eggs with salt and pepper. Bake until yolks have clouded over but still give slightly when touched, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer sheet to wire rack and let sit until whites are completely set, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately."]

notes: "We prefer to use raw breakfast sausage links for this recipe, but fully cooked frozen links can also be used; Jimmy Dean Fully Cooked Original Pork Sausage Links are our favorite. Both types of sausage links cook in the same amount of time. The potatoes can be cut, submerged in water, and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Dry them thoroughly with a dish towel before using."
