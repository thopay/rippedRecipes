instructions: ["Pat trout fillets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle all over with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper.","Place flour in shallow dish. Working with 1 fillet at a time, dredge both sides in flour, pressing gently to adhere. Shake off excess and transfer to large plate.","Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until just smoking. Carefully place 2 fillets skin side down in skillet and cook until browned and crispy, 2 to 4 minutes. Using fish spatula, flip fillets flesh side down and cook until flesh is opaque and begins to turn golden, about 1 minute.","Transfer cooked fillets to large serving platter flesh side up. Repeat cooking and transferring with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and remaining 2 fillets.","Add butter to now-empty skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until butter is golden brown with toasted aroma, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in almonds and cook, swirling skillet occasionally, until almonds are deep golden brown, about 2 minutes.","Immediately remove skillet from heat and quickly but carefully stir in lemon zest and juice and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, scraping up any browned bits. Pour sauce over fillets, sprinkle with parsley, and serve."]

notes: "Use raw sliced almonds here—toasted ones can burn. We developed this recipe using farm-raised rainbow trout fillets. If you cant tell the color of the butter in the nonstick skillet in step 5, quickly spoon some onto a white plate to check."
