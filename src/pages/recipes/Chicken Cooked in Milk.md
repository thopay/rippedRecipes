serves: 4
time: "1¾ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Spray large Dutch oven with vegetable oil spray. Thoroughly whisk milk and baking soda together in Dutch oven. (Do not add wine before baking soda.) Whisk in wine, then add garlic.","Combine 2 teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper in bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Tie legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wingtips behind back. Rub entire surface of chicken with oil and sprinkle all over with salt mixture. Place chicken in pot, breast side up. Roast, uncovered, until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, about 1 hour.","Insert tongs into cavity of chicken and tilt chicken to let juices from cavity drain into pot, then transfer chicken to carving board. Discard any milk skin that has attached to chicken. Let chicken rest for 20 minutes.","Meanwhile, add thyme sprigs and lemon zest to pot and bring to simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking often, until sauce reduces to about 1½ cups and coats back of spoon, 8 to 12 minutes.","Strain sauce through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much sauce as possible; discard solids. Whisk any accumulated chicken juices into sauce. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Carve chicken and serve with sauce."]

notes: "Use only whole milk here; milk with a lower fat content will curdle. Its important to whisk together the milk and baking soda, which is key to keeping this sauce from curdling, before adding anything else to the pot in step 1. Do not skip this step. As the chicken braises, a brown skin of milk will form around the chicken. This is OK. Simply discard it when the chicken is done. We developed this recipe in a 7-quart enameled cast-iron Dutch oven. If you use a smaller pot, youll likely need to increase the simmering time in step 4."
