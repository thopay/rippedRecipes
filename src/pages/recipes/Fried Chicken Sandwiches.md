time: "1 hour, plus 30 minutes refrigerating"
instructions: ["Combine salt, paprika, pepper, garlic powder, thyme, sage, and cayenne in bowl. Measure out 1 tablespoon spice mixture and set aside. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Using meat pounder, gently pound each chicken piece to even 1/2-inch thickness between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Season chicken all over with remaining 2 3/4 teaspoons spice mixture.","Whisk flour, baking powder, and reserved 1 tablespoon spice mixture together in large bowl. Add water to flour mixture and rub together with your fingers until water is evenly incorporated and shaggy pieces form. Place egg whites in shallow dish.","Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Working with 1 piece at a time, dip chicken in egg whites to thoroughly coat, letting excess drip back into dish, then dredge in flour mixture, pressing to adhere. Transfer chicken to prepared wire rack and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.","Add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 1 1/2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Add chicken to hot oil. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 325 and 350 degrees. Fry, stirring gently to prevent pieces from sticking together, until chicken is golden brown and registers 160 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through frying. Transfer to clean wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve on rolls."]

notes: "Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more. We like to serve these sandwiches topped with shredded iceberg lettuce, sliced onion, and dill pickle chips and slathered with one of our flavored mayonnaises, like our Hot Cherry Pepper Mayonnaise."
