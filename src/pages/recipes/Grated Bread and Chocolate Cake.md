instructions: ["FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper, grease parchment, then flour pans. Whisk almond flour, all-purpose flour, bread crumbs, chocolate, and baking powder together in bowl.","Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites on medium- low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add sugar and whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes longer.","Gently whisk wine and lemon juice into whipped egg whites by hand. Gently fold in one-third of flour mixture to combine until a few streaks of flour remain. Fold in remaining flour mixture, in 2 additions, until incorporated.","Divide batter evenly between prepared pans and smooth tops. Lightly tap pans on counter to release air bubbles. Bake until light golden brown and cakes feel firm and spring back when touched, about 20 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking.","Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Run paring knife around pan edge. Remove cakes from pans, discarding parchment, and let cool completely, about 2 hours.","FOR THE FROSTING: Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip cream, sugar, and cocoa on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer.","Mark middle of sides of each cake round at several points with knife. Using marks as guide, score edge of each round with long serrated knife, slowly cutting inward to slice each into 2 even layers. Place 1 bottom round on platter. Brush with 1 tablespoon amaretto and spread 2/3 cup whipped cream over top. Repeat twice, ending with cake layer. Press lightly to adhere. Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon amaretto. Frost cake with remaining whipped cream and sprinkle top with chocolate. Serve."]

notes: "We used store-bought bread crumbs for convenience. Look for almond flour in the natural foods section of your market. This cake can overbake quickly, so check often once it begins to color."
