instructions: ["For the dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. Lightly grease large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Coat 13 by 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.","Mix milk, syrup, and melted butter together in large measuring cup. Mix flour, yeast, and salt together in bowl of standing mixer fitted with dough hook. Turn machine to low and slowly add milk mixture. After dough comes together, increase speed to medium and mix until shiny and smooth, 4 to 6 minutes. (Dough will be sticky; if it seems too wet and is not forming ball, add up to 1/4 cup more flour as needed and knead dough 2 minutes more.) Turn dough onto heavily floured work surface, shape into ball, and place in greased bowl. Cover and rest in warm oven for 10 minutes.","For the filling: While dough is resting, mix sugars, cinnamon, salt, and melted butter in medium bowl until incorporated.","To make the rolls: On lightly floured work surface, roll dough into 18 by 12-inch rectangle with long side facing you. Sprinkle sugar mixture over dough, leaving 1/2 inch border along top edge, then lightly press sugar into dough (see photo 1 below). Starting at edge nearest you, roll up dough (photo 2 below). Brush border with water, then press dough to seal.","Using chef’s knife, slice dough into 12 rounds (photo 3 below), then place in prepared pan with cut side up. Cover pan with plastic wrap coated with cooking spray and return to warm oven until rolls have nearly doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes.","Remove pan from oven and heat oven to 350 degrees (rolls will continue to rise on counter as you wait for oven to heat). Remove plastic wrap and bake until rolls are deep brown and filling is melted, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating pan front to back halfway through baking.","For the icing: While rolls are baking, whisk confectioners’ sugar, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla together in small bowl until smooth. Remove pan from oven, turn rolls out onto rack, and flip them right side up. Cool 10 minutes, then spread icing over rolls. Serve hot or warm."]

notes: "Depending on the humidity, the dough may need up to 1/4 cup extra flour, as directed in step 2. If you dont have a mixer, in step 2, mix flour, yeast, and salt together in large bowl. Make well in flour, then add milk mixture to well. Stir until dough becomes shaggy and difficult to stir. Turn out onto heavily floured work surface and knead until dough forms cohesive ball and is smooth, about 10 minutes. Proceed as directed."
