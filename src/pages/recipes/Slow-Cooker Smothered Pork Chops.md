Transfer chops to slow cooker.","Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Scatter onions evenly over chops in slow cooker.","Whisk flour and remaining 6 tablespoons oil together in now-empty skillet. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until roux is color of peanut butter, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in remaining spice mixture and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.","Slowly whisk water into roux mixture until gravy is smooth and free of lumps.

notes: "Bottled preground pepper is bland and dusty, so for the best results, grind your own peppercorns. Be sure to use blade-cut pork chops in this recipe; they have enough fat to keep them from drying out over the prolonged cooking time. If you dont have Lawrys Seasoned Salt on hand, you can mix your own by combining ¼ teaspoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon paprika, ¼ teaspoon onion powder, ½ teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon table salt, and 1 teaspoon granulated garlic. (This will give you an extra teaspoon of spice blend; its great sprinkled on eggs or sandwiches.) Serve the chops and gravy with steamed white rice or egg noodles. Garnish with sliced scallions, if desired."
