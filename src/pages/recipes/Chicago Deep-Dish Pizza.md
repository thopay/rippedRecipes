serves: 4
time: "1¾ hours, plus 1 hour 20 minutes rising"
instructions: ["FOR THE DOUGH: Combine water and yeast in 1-cup liquid measuring cup and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk flour, oil, and salt in bowl of stand mixer until oil is evenly incorporated, about 30 seconds.","Fit stand mixer with dough hook. Add water-yeast mixture to flour mixture and mix on low speed until no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, about 5 minutes.","Transfer dough to unfloured counter and shape into ball. Place dough in lightly greased bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.","FOR THE SAUCE: Meanwhile, transfer whole tomatoes to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl (or colander set in sink). Let tomatoes drain for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer tomatoes to medium bowl and, using kitchen shears or your hands, cut or break tomatoes into ½-inch pieces. Return tomatoes to strainer and let drain for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Return tomatoes to bowl; discard tomato liquid. Stir tomato sauce, oil, sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, fennel, granulated garlic, and pepper into tomatoes; set aside. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.)","Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Grease bottoms and sides of 2 dark-colored 9-inch round cake pans with 1 tablespoon oil each. Divide dough evenly between pans, cover with plastic, and let rest for 20 minutes.","Using palm of your hand, press 1 piece of dough flat into pan bottom until dough meets edge of pan. Rotating pan as you work, press dough until it reaches about 1 inch up sides of pan. Arrange 5 mozzarella cheese slices in even layer, then press mozzarella into dough gently with your palms. If dough no longer reaches 1 inch up sides, repeat pressing.","Break sausage into penny-size pieces and distribute half evenly over mozzarella. Press sausage lightly into mozzarella. Spread half of sauce in even layer on top of sausage, taking care to not push any sauce over edge of dough. Sprinkle pizza with half of oregano, then half of Parmesan. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to shape and top second pizza.","Bake pizzas until top edges of crusts are well browned, about 35 minutes. Remove pizzas from oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Using bench scraper or sturdy metal spatula, cut each pizza in pan into 4 wedges. Serve."]

notes: "We call for two dark-colored 9-inch cake pans for this recipe. The dark pan color is essential for achieving a crisp bottom on the pizza. If you have only light-colored pans, you can increase the baking time by 5 minutes, but the crust will not be as crisp as in the dark pans. In step 8, if you prefer, transfer the pizzas to a cutting board before slicing."
