serves: 2
time: "35 minutes"
instructions: ["Place chicken on plate and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Working with 1 breast at a time, starting on thick side, cut breasts in half horizontally. Using meat pounder, gently pound each cutlet to even 1/4-inch thickness between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.","Pat cutlets dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place 1 prosciutto slice on top of each cutlet, pressing to adhere and folding ends of slice as needed to prevent overhang.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sage leaves and cook until leaves begin to change color and become fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds. Using slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to paper towel–lined plate.","Add cutlets to skillet, prosciutto side down, and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Flip cutlets and cook until second side is light golden brown and cutlets are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to platter and tent with aluminum foil.","Reduce heat to medium; add garlic and minced sage to now-empty skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and bring to simmer; cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, until incorporated. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken. Top each cutlet with 1 fried sage leaf. Serve."]

notes: "Freezing the chicken breasts for 15 minutes makes it easier to slice them into cutlets. Our favorite boneless, skinless chicken breasts are from Bell &amp; Evans."
