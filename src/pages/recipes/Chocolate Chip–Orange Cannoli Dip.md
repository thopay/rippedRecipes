notes: "We developed this recipe using our winning whole-milk ricotta cheese, Belgioioso Ricotta con Latte Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese. If you cant find it, look for another high-quality ricotta without stabilizers. Serve with broken cannoli shells, pizzelle, speculoos cookies, butter wafers, broken sugar cones, graham crackers, Florentine cookies, vanilla wafers, or fresh fruit."
