time: "3½ to 4¾ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Season ribs with salt and pepper and arrange bone-side up in roasting pan. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and roast until fat has rendered and ribs are browned, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Transfer ribs to paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons rendered beef fat and discard remaining drippings.","Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Heat reserved fat in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook onion, carrot, and celery until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth, port, vinegar, tapioca, rosemary, and ribs to pot and bring to simmer.","Cover pot and transfer to oven. Cook until sauce is slightly thickened and ribs are completely tender, about 2 hours. Transfer ribs to serving platter. Strain and skim sauce. Serve, passing sauce at table.","Make Ahead: Ribs and sauce can be refrigerated separately for up to 3 days. When ready to serve, heat sauce and ribs together over medium heat until ribs are warmed through."]

notes: "Short ribs come in two styles. English-style ribs contain a single rib bone and a thick piece of meat. Flanken-style ribs are cut thinner and have several smaller bones. While either will work here, we prefer the less expensive and more readily available English-style ribs."
