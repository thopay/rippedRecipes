description: "No doubt about it-grilling a spice-rubbed chicken on top of a beer can looks odd. But if the result is crackling crisp skin and moist, juicy meat, why not give it a try?"

time: ""
instructions: ["For the spice rub: Mix brown sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in bowl.","For the glaze: Stir brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, beer, and hot sauce together in medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon spice rub.","For the rest: Measure out 1 cup beer from each can; take 2 tablespoons from measured beer and add to ketchup glaze. Prepare beer cans as shown in photo 1, and add 2 crumbled bay leaves to each can.","Prepare chickens as shown in photos 2 through 4 below.","Soak wood chips in bowl of water to cover for 15 minutes, then place chips in small aluminum tray and play tray directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high and close lid, keeping grill covered until wood chips begin to smoke, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high, and turn off all other burners. Place chickens (on cans) on cool part of grill.","Cover and grill until skin is well browned and very crisp, 40 to 60 minutes. Brush with ketchup glaze and grill, covered, until thigh meat registers 170 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes longer. Wearing oven mitts or using wad of paper towels, transfer chickens (still on cans) from grill to cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Hold base of can with oven mitt or wad of paper towels, insert tongs into neck cavity of chicken, and pull chicken off can. Carve and serve."]

notes: "Look for chickens that weigh between 3 and 3 1/2 pounds; if they are significantly larger, you may have trouble fitting the lid on the grill.  To hold the wood chips, you will need a small disposable aluminum tray."
