Remove sheet from oven. Using rubber spatula, push vegetables to 1 side of sheet. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on now-empty side of sheet. Roast until chicken registers 160 degrees and vegetables are completely softened, about 25 minutes, stirring vegetables and rotating sheet halfway through roasting.","Remove sheet from oven, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.

notes: "Be sure to use a heavyweight rimmed baking sheet; flimsy sheets can warp in a hot oven. Our favorite is the Nordic Ware Baker’s Half Sheet. Serve with crusty bread."
