notes: "Use whole, dried hibiscus flowers, not ones that have been cut and sifted. If you can find only ones that have been cut and sifted, use the weight listed (1½ ounces), not the volume. Steens is a popular brand of cane syrup. This recipe can be doubled; to do so, use a Dutch oven or other large pot in step 1. We developed this recipe using dark rum, but you can use golden or light rum, bourbon, gin, tequila, or vodka. To make just one cocktail, fill one collins glass with ice and add 6 ounces of tea and 1½ ounces of rum; stir to combine before garnishing."
