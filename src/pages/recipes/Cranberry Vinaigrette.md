notes: "Fresh and frozen cranberries work equally well, although frozen berries will need an extra couple of minutes to soften. This recipe doubles easily. Apart from salad, you can serve this dressing with steamed asparagus or green beans, poached salmon, or combine 1/4 cup dressing with 5 cups cooked turkey, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, and 2 finely chopped celery ribs for turkey salad."
