notes: "“My mother always made deviled eggs at Easter to use up the dozens of eggs we colored for our baskets. I thought I had outgrown this dish until I inherited my grandmother’s deviled egg plate. When we moved to the Chesapeake Bay last year, I added crabmeat and Old Bay seasoning in honor of my new home. The crowds remain pleased!” Be sure to use brined horseradish (instead of creamy) in this recipe."
