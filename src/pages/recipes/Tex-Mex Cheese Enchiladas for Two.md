Add onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add chili powder, flour, tomato paste, garlic, oregano, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in broth and bring to simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Measure out 1 cup sauce and set aside, leaving remaining sauce in skillet.","For the enchiladas: Stack tortillas and wrap in damp dish towel. Microwave until pliable, about 30 seconds. Place ¼ cup Monterey Jack across center of 1 tortilla, tightly roll tortilla around cheese, and place seam side down in sauce in skillet. Repeat with remaining 5 tortillas and 1¼ cups Monterey Jack, arranging enchiladas side by side in single row in skillet.","Pour reserved sauce over enchiladas and sprinkle with remaining ½ cup Monterey Jack. Bake, covered, until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until sauce is bubbling around edges, about 5 minutes longer. Sprinkle with onion and serve with lime wedges."]
