instructions: ["FOR THE COOKIES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside. Process oats and raisins in food processor until very finely ground, about 1 minute.","Whisk brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, melted butter, molasses, and cinnamon in large bowl until smooth. Whisk in egg and yolk and vanilla until smooth. Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir in flour mixture until evenly combined and no dry flour remains. Stir in oat-raisin mixture until evenly distributed. (Mixture will be stiff; once dough begins to stiffen, you can mix with your hands until dough is evenly combined.)","Divide dough into twenty-four 1⅓-ounce portions, about 1½ tablespoons each. Roll dough portions between your hands to form smooth balls. Evenly space dough balls on prepared sheets, 12 balls per sheet. Using your hand or bottom of dry measuring cup, flatten balls to ½-inch thickness.","Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until tops are beginning to crack at edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 45 minutes.","FOR THE FILLING: Process all ingredients in now-empty processor until smooth and fluffy, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer to bowl and stir to incorporate any dry sugar.","Spread 1 scant tablespoon creme filling on bottoms (flat sides) of each of 12 cookies. Top with remaining cookies to form sandwiches. Serve. (Assembled cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days.)"]

notes: "Regular old-fashioned rolled oats work best in this recipe. Do not use extra-thick rolled oats, as they will bake up tough in the cookies. For cookies with just the right amount of spread and chew, we strongly recommend that you weigh your ingredients. The cookies will seem underdone when you pull them from the oven. This is OK; they will continue to bake as they cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. This method ensures that the cookies remain chewy once they have cooled."
