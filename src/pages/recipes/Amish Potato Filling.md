time: "1¾ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Grease 13 by 9-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Place bread on rimmed baking sheet and bake until dry and golden brown in spots, about 22 minutes, stirring halfway through baking. Set aside. (Cooled bread can be stored in zipper-lock bag for up to 2 days.)","Meanwhile, place potatoes and 1 tablespoon salt in large saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until tender and paring knife slips easily in and out of potatoes, about 12 minutes.","Drain potatoes and transfer to large bowl. Using potato masher, mash potatoes until smooth and no lumps remain. Stir in half-and-half, 6 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¾ teaspoon pepper until butter is melted. Set aside.","In now-empty saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery, poultry seasoning, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook until vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes, stirring often. Add broth and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits, then remove from heat.","Add broth mixture to mashed potatoes and stir until combined (mixture will be wet). Add toasted bread and stir until all bread is evenly coated with potato mixture. Transfer filling to prepared dish and distribute evenly but do not pack down or smooth top. Cut remaining 2 tablespoons butter into 8 pieces and distribute evenly over top of filling.","Bake until surface is well browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve."]

notes: "For the best results, be sure to use a hearty white sandwich bread here. We prefer Yukon Gold potatoes in this recipe, but russet potatoes will work in a pinch. We developed this recipe using Bell’s poultry seasoning. Do not smooth the top of the filling before baking the casserole; the uneven surface will brown as it bakes and create a crunchy texture that contrasts nicely with the smooth filling below it."
