instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Grease 13 by 9-inch metal baking pan with 1 tablespoon oil. Cut off top ½ inch of bell peppers and reserve; discard stems and seeds. Arrange bell peppers and their tops cut side down in prepared pan. Brush bell peppers and tops with 1 tablespoon oil, then season with salt and pepper.","Roast until bell peppers are softened and beginning to blister, about 20 minutes. Flip bell peppers cut side up and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Season insides with salt and pepper. Adjust oven temperature to 350 degrees.","Using potato masher, mash chickpeas coarse in large bowl. Chop bell pepper tops into ¼-inch pieces and add to bowl with chickpeas.","Heat ¼ cup oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add bread and cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Push bread to 1 side of skillet and add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to empty spot. Add garlic and pepper flakes to oil and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir garlic mixture and ½ teaspoon salt into bread to combine. Transfer to bowl with chickpea mixture; let cool completely, about 10 minutes.","Stir scallions, parsley, basil, capers, lemon zest and juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper into chickpea mixture. Gently fold in goat cheese until combined.","Divide filling evenly among bell peppers, mounding slightly. Bake until filling registers between 100 and 120 degrees and begins to brown on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to platter and drizzle with extra oil. Serve."]

notes: "Laura Chenel’s Chevre Fresh Chevre Log is our favorite goat cheese. Note that we bake the peppers in a metal baking pan, not a ceramic baking dish; the metal pan gets hotter."
