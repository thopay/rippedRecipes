title: Herbed Roast Pork Tenderloin
author: America's Test Kitchen
pubDate: 2023-03-15
description: "Recipes abound for herb-flavored pork tenderloin, but the meat rarely takes on any flavor. By folding two herb-coated pork tenderloins together, we create a larger mass of meat that can stay in the oven long enough to obtain a nicely browned crust."

notes: "Pork tenderloins can vary greatly in weight; try to find 2 large roasts for this recipe. We prefer to remove the tough silver skin with a paring knife before butterflying."
