time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["Cut kernels from cobs (you should have about 2¼ cups). Scrape pulp from cobs, keeping separate from kernels.","Combine milk, water, two-thirds of kernels (about 1½ cups), and pulp in large saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Whisk in grits, half of garlic, 1½ teaspoons salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and return to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover; and simmer, whisking often, until thick and creamy, about 25 minutes. Off heat, stir in 2 tablespoons butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm.","Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add scallion whites, remaining garlic, remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining ⅛ teaspoon pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add remaining one-third of kernels (about ¾ cup) and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.","Off heat, stir scallion greens into skillet. If grits are too thick, adjust consistency by gradually whisking in additional hot water as needed until creamy. Serve grits, topping individual portions with corn-scallion mixture."]

notes: "If you use fresh-milled grits such as Anson Mills Colonial Coarse Pencil Cob Grits, you will need to increase the simmering time by 25 minutes and may need to add more water during simmering in step 2."
