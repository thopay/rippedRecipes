ingredients: ["7 cups (21 ounces), old-fashioned rolled oats","1/2 cup, vegetable oil","1/2 teaspoon, salt","3/4 cup, honey","3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces), light brown sugar","1 tablespoon, vanilla extract","2 teaspoons, ground cinnamon (optional)","1 1/2 cups, almonds, pecans, peanuts, or walnuts, chopped coarse"]
serves: 36
time: "1¾ hours, plus 20 minutes cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Toss oats, oil, and salt together in medium bowl. Spread mixture over rimmed baking sheet and toast, stirring often, until pale golden, 20 to 25 minutes.","Meanwhile, line 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease foil. Cook honey and sugar in small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is fully dissolved, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in vanilla and cinnamon, if using.","Transfer toasted oat mixture to large bowl. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Add honey mixture and almonds to oat mixture and toss until well combined. Transfer mixture to prepared sheet and press firmly into even layer with greased metal spatula.","Bake bars until golden, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let bars cool completely in sheet on wire rack for 15 minutes, then cut into 36 pieces. Let cool completely, then remove individual bars from sheet with spatula. Serve. (Bars can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.)"]

notes: "If any of the bars should fall apart during cutting, just press them back together; as they cool they will firm up and stick together. Do not substitute quick or instant oats in this recipe. Dont use a baking sheet smaller than 18 by 13 inches or the bars will be too thick and wont bake evenly. Be sure to let the granola bars cool for 15 minutes before cutting."
