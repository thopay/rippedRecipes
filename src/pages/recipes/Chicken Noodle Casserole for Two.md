Off heat, sprinkle Parmesan evenly over panko mixture and stir to combine, breaking up any clumps.

Add mushrooms, shallots, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and cook until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are golden brown, about 8 minutes.","Add chicken and flour and stir until no dry flour remains. Cook for 1 minute. Stir in half-and-half and broth and bring to simmer. Stir in noodles, submerging them as much as possible, and cook, uncovered, stirring often, until noodles are tender and sauce is thickened (rubber spatula will leave trail that takes about 3 seconds to fill in), about 8 minutes.","Stir in cheddar, peas, remaining ⅛ teaspoon salt, and remaining ⅛ teaspoon pepper until cheese is completely melted and peas are warmed through, about 2 minutes.
