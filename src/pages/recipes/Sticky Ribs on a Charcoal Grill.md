ingredients: ["3 tablespoons, paprika","2 tablespoons, light brown sugar","1 tablespoon, ground black pepper","1 tablespoon, table salt","1/4 teaspoon, cayenne pepper","2 full racks, pork spareribs, preferably St. Louis cut, trimmed of any large pieces of excess fat, membrane removed, and patted dry (see photo 1)","2 cups, wood chips","2 cups, barbecue sauce"]
serves: 6
time: ""
instructions: ["Combine paprika, sugar, pepper, salt, and cayenne in small bowl. Massage spice rub into both sides of rib racks.","Soak wood chips in bowl of water for 15 minutes. Open bottom grill vents completely. Light large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal briquettes (about 60 coals) and burn until covered with fine gray ash. Arrange 13 by 9-inch disposable aluminum pan on one side of grill and pour hot coals into pile on opposite side. Sprinkle 1 cup wood chips over coals, set grill rack in place, and position ribs over pan.","Place sheet of aluminum foil directly on top of ribs (see photo 2) and cover grill, positioning lid vents (three-quarters open) directly over ribs. Barbecue, turning and rotating ribs after 1 hour, until coals are almost spent, about 2 hours.","About 20 minutes before coals are spent, light another 60 coals in chimney starter and burn until covered with fine gray ash. Place hot coals from chimney on top of spent coals, and sprinkle remaining cup wood chips over coals. Turn and rotate ribs and barbecue, covered, for 1 hour. Brush ribs liberally on both sides with sauce, wrap tightly with foil (see photo 3), and barbecue until very tender, about 1 hour longer.","Transfer ribs (still in foil) to cutting board and rest 30 minutes. Unwrap ribs and brush with additional barbecue sauce. Slice ribs between bones and serve with remaining sauce.","To Finish in the Oven: In step 4, instead of adding more charcoal to the grill, wrap ribs tightly in foil, place on baking sheet, and bake in 250-degree oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven, brush both sides with barbecue sauce, rewrap with foil, and bake until very tender, about 1 hour longer. Proceed as directed in step 5."]

notes: "Buy St. Louis–style racks, which are more manageable than untrimmed pork ribs. We prefer our sauce recipe (see related recipe), but store-bought works, too (Bull’s-Eye is our favorite). If youre not keen on tending a grill for 4 hours, our ribs will still taste good even if they spend the last 2 hours of cooking in your oven; see optional step 6."
