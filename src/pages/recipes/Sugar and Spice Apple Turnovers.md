instructions: ["Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in small bowl.","Pulse apples, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, lemon juice, and salt in food processor until chopped into pieces no larger than 1/2 inch. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, then drain in fine-mesh strainer set over bowl. Reserve juices. Transfer apple mixture to medium bowl and stir in applesauce.","Unfold 1 sheet puff pastry onto lightly floured work surface and roll into 10-inch square. Cut into four 5-inch squares and fill each turnover with 2 tablespoons apple mixture, brush edges with reserved apple juice, then fold and crimp (see photos). Place turnovers on plate and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Repeat with remaining sheet puff pastry and filling.","Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. With turnovers still on large plate, brush tops with reserved apple juice and sprinkle with spice sugar. Place 4 turnovers on each baking sheet and bake until well browned, 20 to 26 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through baking time. Transfer turnovers to wire rack and let cool slightly. Turnovers can be served warm or at room temperature.","Make Ahead","You can fill, fold, and freeze the unbaked turnovers up to 1 month in advance. Freeze them on a baking sheet, then transfer to a zipper-lock freezer bag. Before baking, allow the turnovers to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, then proceed with the recipe as directed."]
