description: "This quick bread can be on the table in less than an hour. But many loaves taste sour, or have negligible cheese flavor. We wanted an easy, lighter loaf of bread enhanced with the yeasty flavor of beer and a big hit of cheese."

notes: "Insert the toothpick in a few spots when testing for doneness; it may hit a pocket of cheese, which resembles uncooked batter on the toothpick. Strongly flavored beers make the bread bitter, so mild American lagers like Budweiser work best here."
