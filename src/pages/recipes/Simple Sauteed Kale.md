serves: 8
time: "50 minutes"
instructions: ["Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat.","Meanwhile, stem kale by grasping leaves between your thumb and index finger at base of stem and pulling from bottom to top of stem to strip off leaves. Cut leaves into 2-inch pieces. Trim and discard bases of stems thicker than ½ inch. Cut remaining stems into ½-inch pieces. Transfer kale to large bowl and wash thoroughly.","Add 2 tablespoons salt to boiling water. Add kale to pot, 1 handful at a time, submerging with tongs as needed. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leaves are tender and stems are just al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain in colander and let sit for 5 minutes, occasionally pressing on kale with rubber spatula to release excess moisture. (Drained kale can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)","Heat ¼ cup oil in now-empty pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook until garlic is lightly browned, 30 to 60 seconds. Add kale and cook, stirring frequently, until stems are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving platter and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Serve."]

notes: "You can substitute Lacinato kale (also known as dinosaur or Tuscan kale) for the curly kale in this recipe, if desired. Its important to boil the kale in the full 4 quarts of water; with less water it can become too salty."
