serves: 6
time: "3 to 3½ hours"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Cut pork crosswise into 3 slabs, then cut each slab in half crosswise (some pieces may separate slightly along natural seams; this is OK). Pat pork dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add pork and cook until well browned all over, 15 to 18 minutes; transfer to plate.","Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot and return to medium-high heat. Add garlic, anchovies, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour and cook for 30 seconds. Whisk in broth, wine, and vinegar, scraping up any browned bits and smoothing out any lumps. Stir in half of prunes, half of olives, half of capers, bay leaves, and oregano. Return pork and any accumulated juices to pot and bring to simmer. Cover and transfer pot to oven. Cook until fork inserted into pork meets little to no resistance, 2 to 2½ hours.","Remove pot from oven. Add remaining prunes, olives, and capers to pot, submerging them in braising liquid, and let rest, covered, until prunes have softened, about 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Stir 2 tablespoons parsley into sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley. Serve."]

notes: "Pork butt roast is often labeled Boston butt in the supermarket. Avoid buying a pork butt wrapped in netting; it will likely contain smaller, separate lobes of meat rather than one whole roast. If youre using table salt, reduce the amount called for by half. Serve with egg noodles or couscous."
