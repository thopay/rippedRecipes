notes: "For the best results, we prefer to let the chicken marinate overnight, but just 1 hour works if you are short on time. Plan ahead: The chicken needs to chill for at least 1 hour after coating. Use a Dutch oven with at least a 6-quart capacity. Serve the tenders with one of our dipping sauces."
