description: "Mississippi mud might not sound like something youd like to eat, but Mississippi mud brownies definitely are. To maximize the chocolate flavor in these moist brownies, we added cocoa powder to the brownie base and kept the amount of sugar in check."

instructions: ["FOR THE BROWNIES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 13- by 9-inch baking dish with aluminum foil, allowing excess to overhang edges. Spray foil with cooking spray.","Melt chocolate and butter in large heatproof bowl set over medium saucepan filled with 1/2 inch of barely simmering water (don’t let bowl touch water), stirring occasionally, until smooth, 5 to 7 minutes; cool slightly. Combine flour, cocoa, and salt in bowl. Whisk sugar and eggs in separate bowl, then whisk in melted chocolate mixture. Stir flour mixture into chocolate mixture until no streaks of flour remain. Fold in pecans and scrape batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out with a few wet crumbs attached, about 35 minutes. Transfer to wire rack.","FOR THE TOPPING: Spoon marshmallow creme over hot brownies and let sit until softened, about 1 minute. Meanwhile, microwave chocolate chips and oil in small bowl until smooth, 30 to 60 seconds. Following photos at right, spread marshmallow creme evenly over brownies and then drizzle with chocolate. Cool brownies in pan for at least 2 hours. Using foil overhang, lift brownies from pan and cut into 2-inch squares. Serve. (Brownies can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for 2 days.)"]
