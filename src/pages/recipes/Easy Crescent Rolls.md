description: "Most recipes for crescent rolls require a lot of tedious work to layer butter into the dough before baking. But there is an easier, faster version that yields rolls just as rich and buttery."

serves: 12
time: "1¼ hours, plus 2 hours rising"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees, shut oven off. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Grease large bowl.","Whisk melted butter, half-and-half, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in large liquid measuring cup until yeast dissolves, then whisk in 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, remaining sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt until combined. With mixer on low, add warm half-and-half mixture in steady stream and mix until dough comes together, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough is smooth and comes away from sides of bowl, about 6 minutes. Turn dough out onto clean surface and knead to form smooth, round ball. Transfer dough to prepared bowl, cover with plastic, and place in warm oven. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.","Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and roll into 12-inch circle. Spread softened butter over dough, sprinkle with remaining salt, and, following photos 1 and 2 (see \"How to Shape Crescent Rolls\" below), cut dough into 12 wedges, roll each wedge, and arrange (with pointed tip of dough underneath each roll) on prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and return to oven until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (At this point, rolls can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)","Remove rolls from oven and discard plastic wrap; heat oven to 350 degrees. Whisk remaining egg white and water in small bowl. Brush each roll twice with egg white mixture and bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through cooking. Cool rolls on baking sheet 10 minutes. Serve. (Once completely cool, rolls can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for 2 days.)"]

notes: "A pizza cutter makes quick work of cutting the dough into wedges (see related Step by Step); alternately, you can use a chef’s knife or metal scraper."
