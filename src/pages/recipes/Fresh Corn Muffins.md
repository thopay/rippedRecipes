notes: "We developed this recipe using Quaker Yellow Corn Meal. Yellow or white cornmeal can be used. Three medium ears of corn should yield at least 2 cups of corn kernels. If you dont own a microwave, the cornmeal paste can also be made in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Just be sure to whisk it constantly so that the ingredients dont scorch on the bottom of the saucepan. These corn muffins are great on their own or with our Cardamom–Brown Sugar Butter."
