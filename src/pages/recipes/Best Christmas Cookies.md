ingredients: ["2 3/4 cups (13¾ ounces), all-purpose flour","1 1/4 cups (8¾ ounces), sugar","1 teaspoon, baking powder","1/4 teaspoon, table salt","2 , large egg yolks","6 tablespoons, sour cream","1 tablespoon, vanilla extract","12 tablespoons, unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), melted and slightly cooled"]
serves: 30
time: ""
instructions: ["Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk yolks, sour cream, and vanilla in second smaller bowl until well combined. Whisking constantly, gradually pour butter into sour cream mixture; whisk until incorporated. Pour wet mixture into dry mixture and stir with rubber spatula until combined. Knead dough by hand in bowl until flour is completely incorporated and dough has formed ball. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface and divide in half. Shape each half into 3/4-inch-thick rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour (can also freeze for 30 minutes).","Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out 1 rectangle of dough between 2 sheets of lightly floured parchment paper to an even 1/8-inch thickness. (If dough seems soft, slide rolled dough, still between parchment, onto baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.) Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutter(s) and place cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart.","Bake until cookies are lightly browned around edges, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating baking sheets halfway through baking time. Repeat process with remaining dough. (Dough scraps can be kneaded together and rerolled.) Cool cookies on wire rack to room temperature before glazing and decorating, (see related recipe for No-Fuss Icing)."]

notes: "This dough can be rerolled repeatedly without getting tough. If it becomes too soft to roll out or cut without sticking, return it to the refrigerator until firm. Resist the urge to add more flour. Rolling the dough between sheets of parchment paper is key to prevent sticking."
