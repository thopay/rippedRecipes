notes: "We prefer our homemade Coffee Liqueur in this recipe, but you can substitute your favorite store-bought coffee liqueur. This recipe can easily be scaled to serve a crowd; prepare larger batches through step 2 and hold the coffee mixture in a thermal carafe or slow cooker set to the lowest setting until ready to serve."
