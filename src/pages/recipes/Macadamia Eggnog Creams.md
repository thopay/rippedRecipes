instructions: ["Whisk flour, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt together in medium bowl. Whisk 1/2 cup eggnog and egg together in measuring cup. With electric mixer, beat butter and granulated and brown sugars together on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add flour mixture and eggnog mixture alternately, in two batches, beating after each addition until incorporated. Divide dough into quarters and wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.","Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.","Using rolling pin, roll each dough quarter into 12-inch round about 1/8 inch thick. Cut with 3-inch star cutter and transfer to prepared baking sheets (scraps can be re-rolled once). Bake until lightly browned around edges, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating rack position and direction of baking sheets halfway through baking time. Cool cookies completely on baking sheets. Use remaining dough to make second batch of cookies.","When cookies have cooled, whisk remaining 2 tablespoons eggnog and rum together in medium bowl. Whisk in confectioners’ sugar until smooth. Spoon glaze over cookies and sprinkle with nuts. Do not touch until glaze sets, about 30 minutes."]
