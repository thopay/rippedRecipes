Remove neck and giblets from cavity and reserve for gravy. Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Tuck legs into pocket of skin at tail end (alternatively, tie legs with kitchen twine) and tuck wings under bird.","BUTTER AND SEASON Line V-rack with foil and poke several holes in foil. Set rack inside large roasting pan and spray foil with cooking spray. Brush breast and legs of turkey with half of butter and season with salt and pepper. Arrange turkey, breast-side down, in rack. Brush remaining butter over back of turkey and season with salt and pepper. Roast turkey for 1 hour.","FLIP TURKEY Remove turkey from oven. (If roasting 18- to 22-pound turkey, reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and do not flip.) Tip juices from cavity of turkey into pan. Using clean pot holders or kitchen towels, carefully flip turkey breast-side up. Roast until breast meat registers 160 degrees and thigh meat registers 175 degrees, 1 to 1½ hours (2 to 2½ hours for 18- to 22-pound turkey). Transfer to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Carve and serve."]
