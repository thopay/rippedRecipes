notes: "Regular bacon can be used in place of the thick-cut bacon, if desired. If you are short on time, you can quick-brine your beans: In step 1, bring 1½ tablespoons of salt, 2 quarts of water, and the beans to a boil in the Instant Pot using the highest saute function; turn off the pot; and let the beans sit for 1 hour. Drain and rinse the beans and proceed with step 2."
