serves: 24
time: "1¼ hours, plus 3 hours cooling"
instructions: ["Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Spray foil with vegetable oil spray.","FOR THE CRUST: Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, and salt in bowl. Add melted butter and stir with rubber spatula until evenly moistened. Crumble dough over bottom of prepared pan. Press dough to even thickness using bottom of dry measuring cup. Using fork, poke dough all over, about 20 times. Bake until crust is fragrant and looks dry, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack. (Crust needn't cool completely before adding topping.)","FOR THE TOPPING: Combine dulce de leche, sugar, cream, corn syrup, butter, and table salt in large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat, 7 to 9 minutes, stirring frequently with rubber spatula.","Once boiling, continue to cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until mixture registers between 235 and 240 degrees in several places, 9 to 11 minutes longer. (Mixture will be thick and bubbling vigorously.) Off heat, stir in 1½ cups pecans. Pour caramel mixture over crust and spread to even thickness. Sprinkle with chocolate chips and let sit until chocolate chips have softened, about 5 minutes.","Swirl softened chocolate chips through caramel mixture using butter knife. Sprinkle with remaining ½ cup pecans and flake sea salt. Let bars sit at room temperature until chocolate is set, at least 3 hours.","Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan. (Caramel may stick to foil. Use paring knife to separate, if necessary.) Cut into 24 pieces (5 cuts by 3 cuts) and serve. (Bars can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.)"]

notes: "Dulce de leche, a thick, caramel-like sauce, can be found in the international or baking aisle of most supermarkets. If you cant find it, you can substitute one 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk, but the toppings caramel flavor wont be as strong. For a caramel topping with the right texture, monitor the temperature with an instant-read thermometer as it cooks; it is essential to bring the mixture to between 235 and 240 degrees in step 4 for the caramel to set up properly. If youre using an electric stove, the mixture will likely take longer than 11 minutes to reach 235 degrees once it starts to boil. Using a large heavy-bottomed saucepan and stirring frequently will help ensure that the caramel doesnt scorch."
