Arrange roll bottoms, cut side up and side by side, in 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Fold pastrami slices in thirds; place 3 slices on each roll bottom. Divide sauerkraut among sandwiches. Fold Swiss in thirds, then once in half, and place over sauerkraut. Season with pepper and cap with roll tops.","Combine butter, onion, and poppy seeds in bowl. Microwave until butter is melted and onion is softened, about 1 minute. Whisk Worcestershire, garlic powder, and remaining 2 tablespoons mustard into butter mixture until combined. Generously brush tops and edges of sandwiches with all of butter mixture. Spoon any remaining solids over sandwiches.","Cover dish with aluminum foil and let sit for 10 minutes to allow sandwiches to absorb sauce. Bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until cheese is melted around edges and tops are slightly firm, 7 to 9 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Serve.","TO MAKE AHEAD: Sandwiches can be brushed with butter mixture, covered, and refrigerated up to 1 day in advance. Bring to room temperature before baking."]

notes: "We prefer the soft, white dinner rolls found in the bakery section of your supermarket, but dinner-size potato rolls will also work."
