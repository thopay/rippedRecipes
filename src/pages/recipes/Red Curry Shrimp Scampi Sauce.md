notes: "Asian chili-garlic sauce is available near other spicy sauces or Thai and Vietnamese ingredients in most supermarkets. We prefer the creamy richness of full-fat coconut milk to light coconut milk in this pasta sauce recipe. Thin-strand pastas, such as vermicelli and capellini, match well with this sauce."
