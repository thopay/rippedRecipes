ingredients: ["1 (4-pound), whole chicken, giblets discarded","2 (12-inch) wooden, skewers","1 tablespoon, packed light brown sugar","2 teaspoons, kosher salt","2 teaspoons, pepper"]
serves: 4
time: "2 hours, plus 1 hour brining"
instructions: ["Place chicken, breast side down, on cutting board. Using kitchen shears, cut through bones on either side of backbone; discard backbone. Flip chicken over and press on breastbone to flatten. Tuck wingtips underneath. Insert 1 skewer down length of chicken through thickest part of breast and into and through drumstick. Repeat with second skewer on other half of chicken.","Combine sugar, salt, and pepper in bowl. Rub mixture evenly over skin side of chicken. Transfer chicken, skin side up, to plate and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.","FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter mounded with charcoal briquettes (7 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.","FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s). (Adjust primary burner [or, if using three-burner grill, primary burner and second burner] as needed to maintain grill temperature around 400 degrees.)","Clean and oil cooking grate. Place chicken, skin side up, on cooler side of grill with skewers parallel to fire. Cover (position lid vent over chicken if using charcoal) and cook until breasts register 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, about 1 hour, rotating chicken halfway through cooking.","Transfer chicken, skin side up, to carving board; tent with aluminum foil; and let rest for 15 minutes. Remove skewers and carve chicken. Serve."]

notes: "Threading two wooden skewers through the breasts and drumsticks keeps the chicken intact during cooking. Serve the chicken with Red Chimichurri Sauce."
