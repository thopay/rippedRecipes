instructions: ["Process scallions, oil, 3 tablespoons molasses, ginger, allspice, habaneros, garlic, thyme, and salt in blender until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed. Transfer 1/4 cup jerk paste to bowl, cover, and refrigerate until needed. Place ribs on rimmed baking sheet and brush all over with remaining paste. Cover sheet tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.","Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Line second rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Unwrap ribs and place, meat side up, on prepared wire rack. Roast until tender and fork inserted into meat meets no resistance, 4 to 4 1/2 hours.","Stir vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon molasses into reserved jerk paste. Brush meat side of racks with vinegar mixture. Return ribs to oven and roast until sauce sets, about 10 minutes. Transfer ribs to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Slice racks between ribs. Serve with lime wedges."]

notes: "Plan ahead: This recipe requires letting the coated ribs sit for at least 1 hour. We recommend wearing rubber gloves when handling the habaneros—they’re hot! If you are spice-averse, remove the seeds and ribs from the habaneros or substitute jalapenos, which are less spicy."
