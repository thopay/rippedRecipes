description: "In Memphis, traditional barbecue sauce has no place. We wanted a recipe that gave us flavorful ribs with a crispy, crusty exterior, or bark."

time: ""
instructions: ["For the spice rub and mop: Mix spice rub ingredients together in small bowl. Stir cider and vinegar together in small saucepan.","One hour before cooking ribs: Place wood chips in bowl with enough water to cover. Reserve 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon spice rub. With fingers, work remaining rub into both sides of rib racks. Let ribs stand at room temperature until ready to cook.","Thirty minutes before cooking ribs: Light about 45 charcoal briquettes. When coals are covered with thin layer of gray ash, stack them 2 to 3 briquettes high on one side of grill. Set cooking grate in place, open top and bottom vents halfway, cover grill, and let heat for 5 minutes. Drain wood chips.","Position ribs on side of grill without coals. Drop 1/4 cup wood chips through grate onto coals. Cover grill, positioning lid so that vents are opposite coals to draw smoke through grill. Meanwhile, bring mop to simmer; cover and keep warm.","Barbecue ribs until meat starts to pull away from bones and has rosy glow on exterior, 3 to 4 hours. You will need to flip ribs and baste them with mop, as well as replenish charcoal and wood chips, according to schedule in “Tickle Your Ribs,” (see below). At all other times, keep grill covered.","Before removing ribs from grill, sprinkle each rack with 1 tablespoon reserved spice rub. One at a time, place each rack of ribs on grate directly over mound of coals, cooking about 30 seconds on each side, then transfer to cutting board. Tent ribs with foil and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.","While ribs rest, add remaining 1 teaspoon spice rub to remaining mop and simmer, uncovered, until liquid has reduced to about 2 cups, 10 to 15 minutes. Add Tabasco and more salt and pepper to taste, if desired. Slice ribs between bones and serve with sauce on side."]

notes: "These ribs are moderately spicy--adjust the cayenne and Tabasco as you wish. To reheat leftovers, place the ribs in an ovenproof dish, add a few tablespoons of water, cover with foil, and place in a 250-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes."
