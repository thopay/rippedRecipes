notes: "Give the caraway seeds a gentle chop with a chef’s knife; it brings out their flavor and helps disperse them throughout the dish. The test kitchen’s favorite egg noodles are Light‘n Fluffy Wide Egg Noodles. Do not use dried dill or chives in this recipe; their dusty flavor spoils the noodles."
