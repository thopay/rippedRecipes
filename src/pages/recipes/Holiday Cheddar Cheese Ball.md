instructions: ["Process all of the ingredients (except the nuts) in a food processor until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary, about 1 minute. Transfer the cheese mixture to the center of a large sheet of plastic wrap.","Holding the corners of the wrap in one hand, twist the cheese with your other hand to seal the wrap and shape the cheese into a rough ball (mixture will be somewhat loose). Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours. (The cheese ball can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Once the cheese ball is firm, reshape it as necessary into a smooth sphere. Unwrap the cheese ball and roll it in nuts. Let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving."]
