ingredients: ["8 ounces, boneless country-style pork ribs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces","4 teaspoons, soy sauce","1 tablespoon, packed brown sugar","1 teaspoon, cornstarch","1/4 teaspoon, baking soda","2 tablespoons, oyster sauce","1 tablespoon, dry sherry","1 tablespoon, ketchup","1 teaspoon, salt","1/4 teaspoon, pepper","2 cups, long-grain white rice","3 tablespoons, vegetable oil","2 , large eggs, lightly beaten","6 , scallions, white and green parts separated and sliced thin","2 , garlic cloves, minced","1/4 cup, frozen peas, thawed"]
serves: 4
time: "1¼ hours"
instructions: ["Combine pork, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and baking soda in bowl. Let pork mixture sit for at least 15 minutes, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 hour. In separate bowl, combine oyster sauce, sherry, ketchup, salt, pepper, and remaining 2 teaspoons soy sauce; set aside.","Meanwhile, bring 3 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and tender, about 12 minutes. Drain rice in fine-mesh strainer or colander.","Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add pork in single layer and cook, without stirring, until browned, about 2 minutes. Stir pork and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until dark brown on all sides, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to clean bowl.","Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add eggs and stir with rubber spatula until set but still wet, about 15 seconds. Push eggs to 1 side of skillet. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, scallion whites, and garlic to empty side and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds.","Add rice and stir to break up clumps and any large egg curds. Cook until rice begins to sizzle and pop loudly, about 3 minutes. Stir in peas, oyster sauce mixture, pork, and scallion greens and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Serve."]

notes: "The stir-fry ingredients can be prepped while your rice cooks, but be sure to have all the ingredients ready and close by before step 3 so you’re equipped for fast cooking. We preferred the slightly higher fat content and heartiness of country-style pork ribs, but pork blade chops can be substituted with similar results (be sure to account for the weight of the bone when purchasing, though)."
