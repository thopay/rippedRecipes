ingredients: ["1 1/2 cups (7½ ounces), all-purpose flour","1/4 cup (1¾ ounces), sugar","1/4 cup (1 1/8 ounces), malted milk powder","1 tablespoon, baking powder","1/2 teaspoon, baking soda","1 1/4 teaspoons, table salt","1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons, buttermilk","2 , large eggs","4 tablespoons, unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly","1 teaspoon, vegetable oil, plus extra as needed","1/2 cup, maple syrup","1/4 cup, Nutella","1/2 teaspoon, table salt"]
serves: 4
time: "1 hour"
instructions: ["FOR THE PANCAKES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place sheet in oven.","Whisk flour, sugar, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter together in separate bowl (butter may form clumps; this is OK).","Make well in center of flour mixture and pour in buttermilk mixture; gently whisk until just combined (batter should remain lumpy, with few streaks of flour). Do not overmix. Let batter sit for 10 minutes. (Do not stir batter after resting.)","FOR THE NUTELLA MAPLE SYRUP: Meanwhile, whisk maple syrup, Nutella, and salt in bowl until combined.","Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet.","Using ¼-cup dry measuring cup, portion batter into skillet in 3 places. Cook until edges of pancakes are set, bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, and underside is golden brown, about 3 minutes.","Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer pancakes to prepared wire rack in oven (or serve as they're ready). Repeat with remaining batter, using extra oil and adjusting heat as necessary if pancakes begin to darken too quickly. Serve with Nutella maple syrup."]

notes: "Do not stir the batter after letting it rest in step 3. Stirring bursts the bubbles created when the baking soda reacts with the buttermilk; these bubbles give the pancakes lift as they cook. The pancakes can be cooked on an electric griddle; set the griddle temperature to 350 degrees and cook the pancakes as directed. This recipe can easily be halved to serve two or doubled to serve a crowd."
