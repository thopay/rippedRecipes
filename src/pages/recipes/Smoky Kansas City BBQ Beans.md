description: "In Kansas City, many barbecue joints stir burnt ends-tough, overcooked bits of smoked brisket, ribs, or pulled pork-into their barbecued beans. This combination of smoke and pork flavor might make Kansas City beans the best in America. We wanted to translate this recipe for the home kitchen."
