If you have less, add water to equal 8 cups.)","Wipe out now-empty Dutch oven with paper towels and heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add white and light green leek parts and carrots and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until edges of rice become translucent, about 2 minutes. Add stock and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes.
