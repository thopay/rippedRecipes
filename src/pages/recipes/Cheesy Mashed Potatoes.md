serves: 6
time: ""
instructions: ["Cover potatoes with 1 inch water in large saucepan. Bring to simmer over high heat (this should take about 10 minutes). Reduce heat to medium and continue to simmer until potatoes are tender and dinner fork can be slipped easily into center, about 20 minutes longer.","Drain potatoes in colander, tossing gently to remove any excess water. Wipe saucepan dry and return potatoes to pan off heat. Using masher, work potatoes into uniform consistency. (Alternatively, push potatoes through ricer or food mill and back into dry saucepan.)","Using large wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir melted butter into potatoes until just combined. Sprinkle salt and pepper over potatoes and add 1/2 cup hot half-and-half and sour cream. Stir until just combined. Stir in remaining half-and-half as needed to achieve desired consistency. Gently fold in 1 1/2 cups cheese. Taste and adjust seasonings. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over potatoes and cover pot with lid. Let sit for 5 minutes and then partially stir in cheese. Transfer potatoes to serving bowl and serve."]

notes: "The amount of half-and-half needed to achieve the correct consistency will depend on the potatoes you use and how well you drain them. It is important for both the butter and the half-and-half to be hot when added to the potatoes to make sure that the cheese melts."
