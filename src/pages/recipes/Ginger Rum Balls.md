notes: "We developed this recipe using a 12-ounce box of vanilla wafers, but the cookies are also available in 11-ounce boxes. If all you can find is an 11-ounce box, there’s no need to buy a second box to make up the extra ounce; just make the balls with 11 ounces of cookies. We prefer the bold flavor of dark rum here, but you can substitute golden or spiced rum, if desired."
