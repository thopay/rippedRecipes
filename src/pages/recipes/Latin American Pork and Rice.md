instructions: ["FOR THE PORK AND BROTH: Combine all ingredients in Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and cook until pork is tender, about 1 hour.","Set colander in large bowl and drain pork, reserving cooking liquid (you should have at least 4 cups; if not, add enough water to equal 4 cups). Discard onion, garlic, and bay leaves. (Cooled pork and broth can be refrigerated in separate airtight containers for up to 2 days.)","FOR THE RICE: Wipe pot clean with paper towels. Add oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add bell pepper, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, pepper, and salt and cook until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.","Stir in rice and Sazon and cook until edges of rice begin to turn translucent, about 2 minutes. Add pork and 4 cups reserved broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, scrape sides of pot clean of any rice, cover, and cook, undisturbed, for 20 minutes.","Keep pot covered and remove from heat; let stand for 20 minutes. Fluff rice with fork. Stir in peas, olives, cilantro, and vinegar. Serve."]

notes: "Sazon is a Latin American spice blend. We developed this recipe using Goya Sazon with Coriander and Annatto (or con Culantro y Achiote). It can be found in the international aisle of most supermarkets; one packet equals about 1½ teaspoons. If you can’t find Sazon, use an equal amount of our homemade version. Let the rice rest for the full 20 minutes before lifting the lid to check it. Long-grain rice may be substituted for medium-grain, but the rice will be slightly less creamy."
